## ⚖️ Evaluation  
* 👨‍🏫 Donald G. Nieman's historical approach provides a comprehensive, chronological narrative of American political development from 1964 to the present, highlighting the role of contingency in the rise of dysfunction.  
* 🔗 The book effectively connects broad societal forces—economic inequality, cultural shifts, and media transformation—to the political changes observed, framing leaders' actions as symptoms rather than primary causes.  
* ⚠️ While Nieman identifies significant drivers of political paralysis, other analyses point to unhealthy competition within the politics industry where parties benefit even if citizens lose, suggesting systemic incentives for dysfunction. [Gehl & Porter, 2020, cite: 1]  
* 😠 Some arguments suggest that intolerance and dislike between groups, rather than just ideological disagreement, are deeper roots of polarization, fueling partisan sorting and cultural divides. [Raleigh News & Observer, 2015, cite: 3]  
* 🗓️ Nieman's emphasis on the post-2008 period for heightened polarization contrasts with some perspectives that trace partisan sorting and obstructionist tactics to earlier periods, like the 1980s-90s with figures like Newt Gingrich. [Reddit, 2024, cite: 15]
