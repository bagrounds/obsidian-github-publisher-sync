## 🤖 AI Summary  
* [💪🏋️‍♂️ Creatine](../topics/creatine.md), traditionally recognized for boosting physical performance, has recently shown potential as an adjunctive therapy for treating depression 😔.  
* 🧠 Creatine's ability to enhance brain energy metabolism and provide neuroprotection 🛡️ suggests it can alleviate mood disorders by improving mitochondrial function, increasing cellular resilience, and modulating neurotransmitter systems that regulate mood 😌.  
* 🧪🔬 Both animal models and human trials indicate creatine's efficacy for the treatment of depression.  
* 💊 Creatine supplementation reduces depressive symptoms, particularly when combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and may improve brain energy metabolism and neuroplasticity 🌱.  
* ⚠️ It is generally well tolerated, though caution is warranted due to potential side effects such as manic episodes in bipolar disorder 🤯 and renal function impairment in patients with kidney dysfunction 😾.  
* ✨ Overall, creatine presents a promising addition to current depression treatments, though further research is needed 🧐 to establish optimal dosing, long-term efficacy, and safety across diverse patient populations.  
* 📝 The review highlights that creatine, traditionally used to enhance physical performance 🏋️, shows promise as an adjunctive management option for depression, especially when combined with antidepressants at a dose of 4-5 g/day for two to eight weeks 📅.  
* 💡 Current research highlights significant promise, particularly among female ♀️ and adolescent patients 🧑‍🦱 with treatment-resistant depression and those with low baseline creatine.
