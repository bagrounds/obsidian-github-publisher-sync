## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
🛠️ In the chaotic workshop, amidst the usual clutter of 🪵 sawdust and 🔩 forgotten screws, lived a peculiar set of 🧰 tools. 🔨 There was Hammer, 😫 perpetually exasperated, his face a caricature of an 😱 open-mouthed scream, always on the verge of 🥱 collapsing from sheer fatigue. 🔧 Leaning against him, the Wrench, 😔 forever burdened with a droopy, melancholic expression, seemed to carry the 🏋️ weight of all the world's unfinished projects. 👶 And then there was Baby Pliers, a chubby, 🍼 pacifier-clutching infant, sprawling across the 🪵 workbench, creating more 🌪️ mess than order. 🎶 Their existence was a symphony of 💨 sighs, 😣 groans, and the occasional 😢 whimper, a testament to the fact that even in the 🌍 world of tools, some days were just 🧱 harder than others.
