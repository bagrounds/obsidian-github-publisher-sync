# 🤔🎬🏆 The Thinking Game | Full documentary | Tribeca Film Festival official selection  
![The Thinking Game | Full documentary | Tribeca Film Festival official selection](https://youtu.be/d95J8yzvjbQ)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* 💡 My goal is to solve artificial general intelligence (AGI), seeing it as the ultimate tool to unlock complex scientific problems \[[02:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=132)].  
* 🏢 We founded DeepMind in London, resisting the Silicon Valley pressure, to prioritize long-term, fundamental research into general learning machines \[[06:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=413)].  
* 🎮 We developed Deep Q-Networks (DQN), combining reinforcement learning and deep learning, enabling a single agent to achieve superhuman performance across 50 Atari games \[[12:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=720)].  
* 🤯 AlphaGo’s historic victory over Lee Sedol included Move 37, a creative maneuver previously unseen in thousands of years of Go strategy \[[17:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=1061)].  
* ⚛️ AlphaZero showed greater generality by learning Chess, Shogi, and Go from scratch, achieving superhuman strength in a single evening with zero human knowledge \[[20:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=1257)].  
* ⚠️ With powerful AGI, we must be extremely cautious; we cannot afford to just move fast and break things, necessitating global coordination for responsible deployment \[[37:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=2259)].  
* 🧬 AlphaFold solved the 50-year-old protein folding problem, predicting structures with outstanding accuracy in the CASP 14 assessment \[[01:14:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=4451)].  
* 🎁 We released the structures of 200 million proteins to the world via the AlphaFold Database, giving this fundamental scientific solution back to humanity \[[01:15:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d95J8yzvjbQ&t=4534)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* 🔬 AlphaFold unquestionably revolutionized structural biology, achieving prediction accuracy competitive with experimental results at CASP14, leading Professor John Moult to declare the 50-year-old grand challenge solved (AlphaFold: a solution to a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology from Google DeepMind).  
* 🛠️ However, external scientific consensus indicates AlphaFold is a powerful prediction tool but has not replaced the need for experimental validation. It largely solved the predictive problem, but did not reveal the underlying physical mechanism or rules of folding, which remains an area of ongoing debate (How AI Revolutionized Protein Science, but Didn't End It from Quanta Magazine).  
* 🤝 On AGI safety, the video’s call for extreme caution and global coordination aligns with expert consensus. A survey of experts found 98% agreed AGI labs should conduct pre-deployment risk assessments, dangerous capabilities evaluations, and third-party model audits (Towards Best Practices in AGI Safety and Governance from GovAI).  
* 🌍 A contrasting perspective highlights a Western-centric bias in current safety discourse. Critics argue the focus on speculative catastrophic risks can overshadow urgent, real-world harms like algorithmic bias and the use of AI for surveillance, which disproportionately affect marginalized communities (A new writing series: Re-envisioning AI safety through global majority perspectives from Brookings).  
* 🔭 Topics to explore for better understanding include:  
    * 🧪 The mechanistic details: Has AlphaFold created a predictive map, or has it truly revealed the fundamental physics of protein folding?  
    * ⚖️ Governance: How can AGI frameworks effectively address current socio-technical harms and incorporate diverse global perspectives beyond the Western paradigm?  
    * 📈 Economics: What will be the specific impact of automating scientific research, as seen with AlphaFold, on academic careers and research funding structures?  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### ❓ Q: What is AlphaFold and what is its main scientific contribution?  
💡 A: AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind that predicts a protein's precise three-dimensional structure based only on its amino acid sequence. This achievement is considered a solution to the 50-year-old grand challenge of protein folding, fundamentally transforming structural biology research.  
  
### ❓ Q: What is Artificial General Intelligence or AGI?  
🧠 A: AGI is a theoretical type of artificial intelligence designed to successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Unlike narrow AI systems, which are restricted to specific tasks, AGI aims for broad cognitive ability, learning, and generalization across multiple domains.  
  
### ❓ Q: How did DeepMind prove the generality of its AI?  
🎯 A: DeepMind proved generality by designing agents like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and AlphaZero. DQN mastered 50 diverse Atari games using a single algorithm, and AlphaZero learned three completely different classic games - Chess, Shogi, and Go - to a superhuman level using zero human instruction.
