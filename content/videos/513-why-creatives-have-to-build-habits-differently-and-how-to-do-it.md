# 🎨🧱🔄 513 - Why Creatives Have to Build Habits Differently and How to Do It  
![513 - Why Creatives Have to Build Habits Differently and How to Do It](https://youtu.be/lmfhGGSsqcA)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
🎯 The 📺 video discusses how 🧑‍🎨 creative individuals can 🤗 embrace 🎨 creative discipline, especially when forming 🏃 habits feels 😟 impossible \[[00:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=21)].  
  
The 🗣️ speaker, Andy J. Pizza, covers several 🔑 key issues:  
  
- 😥 **Difficulty with Conventional Habits**: 📚 Traditional advice on habit formation, which often emphasizes making behaviors automatic, doesn't 📈 work well for 🎨 creative or 🧠 neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD \[[04:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=294)]. The 🗣️ speaker highlights that 💡 creativity requires active thinking, not 🤖 autopilot \[[05:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=322)], and that the point where habits become automatic is often when creative individuals 📉 lose interest and 🛑 give up \[[06:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=389)].  
  
- 🧠 **The "Manual Transmission" Brain**: The 🗣️ speaker likens his creative brain to a 🚗 manual transmission car, meaning he needs to constantly keep things 🤩 interesting and 😂 fun, unlike those with an "automatic" brain who thrive on routine \[[06:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=416)]. This means 🕵️ finding different ways to do the same thing \[[11:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=692)].  
  
- 🤯 **Oxymoron of Creative Discipline**: The very phrase "creative discipline" is presented as an 😜 oxymoron, as "creative" implies 🆕 novelty while "discipline" implies 🔁 repetition \[[03:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=186)]. ⚖️ Striking a balance between these two is inherently 🤹 challenging \[[03:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=195)].  
  
- 🚀 **Importance of "Chase" (Dopamine)**: For 🎨 creative and ADHD individuals, 🏃 motivation is often driven by the "chase" (dopamine) rather than just the 🎉 pleasure of achieving the goal \[[23:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=1400)]. This means 🎁 immediate gratification needs to be integrated into the process of pursuing 🎯 long-term goals \[[24:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=1477)].  
  
- 💡 **Three Habit Science Insights Adapted for Creatives**:  
  
    - 🤝 **Find Groups Where Desired Behavior is the Norm**: 🫂 Surrounding oneself with people who naturally exhibit the desired 🎨 creative discipline can make it 😌 effortless to assimilate those habits \[[17:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=1022)].  
  
    - 🌟 **Make it Your Identity**: 🔄 Shifting one's self-identity to align with the desired 🎨 creative behavior (e.g., "I am an artist, therefore I create") is more 💪 effective than just trying to force a habit \[[19:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=1168)].  
  
    - 🛣️ **Process Over Goal (with a twist)**: While focusing on the 🗺️ process is important, for 🎨 creatives, it's crucial to have "road trip goals" that include 🥳 instant gratification and 🤩 enjoyment along the journey, not just a 🏁 distant objective \[[24:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=1484)].  
  
The 📺 video concludes by introducing the concept of a **"road trip brief"** to help 🎨 creatives build discipline in a way that focuses on 🤩 fun and avoids 😴 boredom, comprising an 🎯 objective, 🚚 deliverables, and 🔀 variables \[[29:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmfhGGSsqcA&t=1745)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
While this 📺 video provides a compelling framework for 🎨 creative and 🧠 neurodivergent individuals to approach discipline, it primarily focuses on an internal, psychological perspective. 🧐 Other perspectives might explore the role of external factors, such as environmental design or accountability systems, in fostering creative habits. For a better understanding, it would be beneficial to explore topics such as:  
  
- 🛠️ Practical tools and apps specifically designed to support flexible, non-linear workflows.  
  
- 🤝 The impact of community and collaboration on creative output and accountability.  
  
- 🔬 Deeper dives into the neuroscience of creativity and ADHD beyond dopamine, exploring other neurotransmitters and brain regions involved.  
  
- 📚 Case studies of successful creative professionals who have implemented similar "manual transmission" approaches.
