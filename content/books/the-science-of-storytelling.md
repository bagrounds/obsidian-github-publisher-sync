# The Science of Storytelling  
by Will Storr  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### **TL;DR** 🤯  
  
"The Science of Storytelling" distills the essence of compelling narratives into a formula based on human psychology, revealing how to craft stories that resonate deeply by understanding the universal desire for a sense of control and the emotional impact of perceived injustice. 🧠💥  
  
### **New or Surprising Perspective** 🌟  
  
Storr's book offers a fresh perspective by grounding storytelling principles in neuroscientific and psychological research. It moves beyond traditional literary analysis, focusing on the human brain's hardwired responses to narrative patterns. This approach demystifies the "magic" of storytelling, revealing it as a predictable, almost scientific process. 🔬💡 Storr surprises by asserting that stories are essentially about the human desire for control and the brain's reaction to perceived injustice, rather than simply entertainment. 😮✨
