## 🫁 A Deep Dive into the Science of a Lost Art  
  
✍️ Journalist James Nestor's *Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art* takes readers on a journey to rediscover the power of something we do 25,000 times a day: 😮‍💨 breathing. Nestor, ✍️ a science journalist who has written for publications like *Scientific American*, *The Atlantic*, and *The New York Times*, explores the profound impact that proper breathing has on our physical and mental health. 📖 The book is a blend of scientific exploration, personal experimentation, and historical investigation into how humanity lost the ability to breathe correctly.  
  
### 👃 The Core Problem: Mouth Breathing  
  
⚠️ The central premise of *Breath* is that modern humans have become chronic mouth-breathers, a shift that Nestor argues has led to a host of health problems. 🍟 This change, attributed in part to the increased consumption of processed foods, has resulted in smaller mouths and crowded teeth, which in turn affects our airways. 🤧 The consequences, according to Nestor, include a rise in ailments like snoring, sleep apnea, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and allergies.  
  
👨‍🔬 To illustrate the detrimental effects of mouth breathing, Nestor and a fellow researcher participated in a 20-day experiment at Stanford University. 👄 For the first ten days, they exclusively breathed through their mouths, leading to a dramatic increase in 😴 snoring, the onset of sleep apnea, and a rise in 🩸 blood pressure. 👃 The following ten days were dedicated to nasal breathing, which reversed these negative effects.  
  
### 🌬️ The Superiority of Nasal Breathing  
  
👍 Nestor advocates for the importance of nasal breathing, highlighting its numerous benefits. 👃 The nose filters, warms, and moistens air, making it easier for the lungs to absorb oxygen. Nasal breathing also increases the production of nitric oxide, a molecule that plays a crucial role in circulation, mood, immunity, and even sexual function.  
  
🔑 Key takeaways on breathing techniques include:  
* 👃 **Breathe through your nose:** It's more efficient and has numerous health benefits.  
* 💨 **Breathe less:** Counterintuitively, taking slower, fewer breaths can increase oxygen absorption.  
* 😮‍💨 **Exhale fully:** Proper exhalation is just as important as inhalation for lung capacity and health.  
* ⏱️ **The ideal breath:** Nestor suggests an optimal breathing rate of about 5.5 breaths per minute, which translates to a 5.5-second inhale and a 5.5-second exhale.  
  
### 🧘 Ancient Wisdom and Modern Science  
  
📜 The book delves into ancient breathing practices like Pranayama from Hindu traditions, Sudarshan Kriya, and Tummo, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation technique. 🧠 Nestor explores how these ancient practices align with modern scientific understanding of the autonomic nervous system. 💪 He explains that by consciously controlling our breath, we can influence bodily functions that are typically considered involuntary, such as heart rate and body temperature.  
  
🧐 *Breath* is not without its critics. 📰 Some reviewers have pointed out that much of the information presented is not new and can be found through online searches. 🧪 Others have wished for more rigorous scientific evidence to back some of the claims. 👍 Despite this, the book has been praised for its engaging storytelling and for making a compelling case for the importance of an often-overlooked bodily function.
