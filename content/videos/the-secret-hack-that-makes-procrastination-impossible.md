# 🚫⏳🔓 the secret hack that makes procrastination impossible  
![the secret hack that makes procrastination impossible.](https://youtu.be/_ic1jc91RO8)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
🍬 The video presents a productivity hack for overcoming procrastination, inspired by the Marshmallow Experiment, and introduces a system called "the life score" \[[04:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=292)\].  
  
* 🍭 **The Marshmallow Experiment and Instant Gratification**: The video references the famous Marshmallow Experiment, where children who could delay eating one marshmallow were rewarded with two later \[[01:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=74)\]. 📈 It highlights that those who waited were generally more successful in life \[[01:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=87)\]. 📱 The speaker equates "marshmallows" to instant gratifications and distractions in daily life, such as phones, computers, or other temptations \[[01:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=107)\].  
* 👀 **The Hawthorne Effect**: The speaker introduces the "Hawthorne effect," a psychological phenomenon where people act differently (usually for the better) when they know they are being observed \[[02:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=173)\]. 😇 He suggests imagining a "godlike scientist" watching your every move to motivate you to make the right choices and avoid procrastination \[[02:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=154)\].  
* ✌️ **The 2x Marshmallow Rule**: This rule suggests that for every marshmallow (instance of procrastination) you avoid during the day, you can double that time and enjoy it guilt-free at the end of the day \[[04:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=253)\]. 🎁 This acts as an immediate reward system for delayed gratification.  
* 📊 **The Life Score**: To implement this, the video proposes tracking your "marshmallow wins" (times you avoided procrastination) and "marshmallow losses" (times you gave in) \[[04:52](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=292)\]. 🏆 This tracking system helps you visualize your progress in the "war for your life" \[[07:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=430)\], emphasizing that consistent small victories lead to long-term success \[[07:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=474)\]. 📈 The speaker also mentions a habit tracker called "you versus 100,000 people" available on his Patreon to help with this \[[10:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ic1jc91RO8&t=618)\].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
While the "2x Marshmallow Rule" and "Life Score" offer a gamified approach to productivity, they primarily focus on self-monitoring and immediate gratification for delayed tasks. This contrasts with approaches that emphasize intrinsic motivation or task restructuring. For a better understanding, it would be beneficial to explore:  
  
* **[♻️🫀🧠💪 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](../topics/cognitive-behavioral-therapy.md) (CBT) techniques**: How do these compare to more established psychological methods for addressing procrastination, which often delve into underlying thought patterns and emotional regulation?  
* ⏱️ **Time management methodologies**: How might this "marshmallow" system integrate with or differ from popular time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique or time blocking, which focus on structured work intervals?  
* 🌱 **Habit formation science**: The video touches on tracking, but a deeper dive into the science of habit formation (e.g., cue-routine-reward loop) could provide more robust strategies for long-term behavior change.
