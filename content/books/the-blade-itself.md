## 📝🐒 Human Notes  
I'm casually, gradually listening for a second time after having devoured the entire First Law universe this summer.  
  
I'm often disappointed by stories, though I don't always know why.  
Not this one. This is my favorite work of fiction.  
I listen to the audiobook.  
The writing is incredible and the voice acting is superb.  
  
Highly recommend.  
Five stars.  
  
Oh, I mean... The book did kind of ruin me. Maybe I'll find a other work of fiction as good... Someday.  
But probably not.  
You have to be realistic.  
  
I should also say, it's not for the squeemish.  
There are very dark themes.
