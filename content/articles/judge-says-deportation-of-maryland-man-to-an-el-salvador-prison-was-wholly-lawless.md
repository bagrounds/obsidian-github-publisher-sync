## 🤖 AI Summary  
### 🚨 Erroneous Deportation of Maryland Man to El Salvador 🇸🇻  
  
• 👨‍⚖️ A federal judge deemed the U.S. government's 🇺🇸 deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador 🇸🇻 as "wholly lawless" ⚖️, ordering his return ↩️.  
  
• 👨‍⚖️ The judge cited 📜 a lack of evidence 🕵️‍♂️ supporting allegations of Abrego Garcia's MS-13 gang affiliation 👥 and a prior immigration judge's 👨‍⚖️ prohibition 🚫 on his deportation to El Salvador 🇸🇻.  
  
• 😭 Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old 🎂 Salvadoran national 🇸🇻 with a U.S. work permit 📝 and no criminal record 🗂️, was detained 👮‍♂️ and deported ✈️ despite lacking any legal basis ⚖️ for such action.  
  
• 🏛️ While the White House 🏢 called the deportation an "administrative error" 🤦‍♂️, the Justice Department 👨‍⚖️ appealed the judge's ruling 👨‍⚖️, highlighting the controversy 🗣️ surrounding the case 📰 and the attorney 🧑‍💼 who admitted the error 😔.
