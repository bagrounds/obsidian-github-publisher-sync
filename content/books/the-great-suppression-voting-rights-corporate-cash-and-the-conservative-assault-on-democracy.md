### 🔎 Evaluation  
  
Zachary Roth's The Great Suppression posits that conservative efforts to restrict voting rights, amplify corporate political spending, and limit local governance are not merely partisan tactics but a deliberate, historically rooted assault on American democracy itself. Objective sources largely corroborate the existence and impact of these phenomena, aligning with the book's central arguments.  
  
* 📝 **Voting Restrictions:** The book highlights increased voter ID laws, reduced early voting, and difficulties with mail-in ballots. The Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan law and policy organization, consistently reports on a wave of restrictive voting laws passed by states, detailing their specific mechanisms like stricter ID requirements, limitations on mail voting and early voting, and more aggressive voter roll purges. These reports confirm the existence and impact of the tactics Roth describes.  
* 📊 **Gerrymandering:** Roth argues that gerrymandering gives the GOP a long-term grip on Congress, irrespective of the popular vote. The Brennan Center for Justice further explains how partisan gerrymandering leads to skewed, unrepresentative maps where electoral outcomes are virtually guaranteed, and disproportionately impacts the political power of minority communities.  
* 💰 **Corporate Cash/Campaign Finance:** The book emphasizes the evisceration of campaign finance laws and the rise of dark money. Reviews and summaries of the book confirm Roth's focus on how the Supreme Court's decisions boosted candidates backed by big money, and how corporate lobbyists work to undermine local regulatory efforts.  
* 🤔 **Anti-Democratic Philosophy:** Roth's contention that a segment of the conservative movement distrusts the very idea of democracy and seeks to limit it is echoed in scholarly and journalistic analyses of the book. Critics and supporters alike acknowledge the book's argument about this underlying anti-egalitarian worldview and historical fears of mob rule resurfacing with the diversification of the electorate.  
  
While some reviews note a potential bias towards Democrats, the factual claims regarding legislative actions, judicial decisions, and lobbying efforts are widely documented by objective sources focusing on election integrity and democratic reforms. The book serves as an urgent wake-up call and a comprehensive look at these trends.
