## 🤖 AI Summary  
### 💬 [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) Prompt  
> Summarize the book: Tiny Habits. Start the summary with a TLDR - a single statement that conveys a maximum of the useful information provided in the book. Next, explain how this book may offer a new or surprising perspective. Follow this with a deep dive. Catalogue the topics, methods, and research discussed. Be sure to highlight any significant theories, theses, or mental models proposed. Provide a critical analysis of the quality of the information presented, using scientific backing, author credentials, authoritative reviews, and other markers of high quality information as justification. Emphasize practical takeaways. Make the following additional book recommendations: the best alternate book on the same topic; the best book that is tangentially related; the best book that is diametrically opposed; the best fiction book that incorporates related ideas; and a book that is more general, more specific, or more rigorous than this book. Format your response as markdown, starting at heading level H4, with inline links, for easy copy paste. Use meaningful emojis liberally to enhance readability, especially in headings and as bullets for lists. Do not include broken links or links to commercial sites (e.g. Amazon).  
  
#### TLDR  
Tiny Habits: Achieve big changes by starting with incredibly small, easy-to-do habits and anchoring them to existing routines, focusing on positive emotions as a reward rather than willpower.  
  
#### New or Surprising Perspective 🤯  
"Tiny Habits" challenges the conventional wisdom of relying on motivation or willpower for behavior change. Instead, it proposes a system where success is practically guaranteed by making habits so small that they are almost effortless. This approach shifts the focus from grand, sweeping changes to incremental, sustainable progress driven by positive emotional reinforcement, revealing that lasting change is less about pushing oneself and more about gentle integration into existing life.  
  
#### Deep Dive 🔬  
* **Topics and Methods:**  
    * Behavior design: The Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAP)  
    * Tiny habits: Making behaviors incredibly small and easy.  
    * Anchoring habits: Connecting new habits to existing routines.  
    * Celebration: Using positive emotions to reinforce habits.  
    * Prompt, ability, motivation (MAP): Understanding the elements of behavior change.  
    * Designing for automaticity: Creating habits that require minimal conscious effort.  
    * Systematic habit creation: A structured approach to building new behaviors.  
    * The importance of emotions over willpower. 🥳  
  
* **Research and Theories:**  
    * The Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAP): This model proposes that behavior occurs when motivation, ability, and a prompt (trigger) converge.  
    * Neuroplasticity: The brain's ability to rewire itself through repeated actions.  
    * Positive reinforcement: The principle that behaviors followed by positive consequences are more likely to be repeated.  
    * The concept of "habit recipes": if after I do X, I will do Y.  
    * The importance of celebrating small wins to solidify the new habit. 🏆  
  
* **Mental Models:**  
    * The "tiny" mindset: Embracing small, achievable steps as a foundation for larger changes.  
    * The "celebration" mindset: Recognizing and reinforcing positive behaviors with genuine joy.  
    * The "prompt" mindset: looking for the natural things that already happen in your day that can be used as a trigger.  
  
* **Critical Analysis:**  
    * Author Credentials: BJ Fogg, PhD, is a behavior scientist at Stanford University, giving his methods a strong academic foundation. 🎓  
    * Scientific Backing: The Fogg Behavior Model is based on established principles of behavioral psychology. The emphasis on positive reinforcement aligns with well-documented psychological research.  
    * Practicality: The book's methods are highly practical and accessible, making them easy to implement.  
    * The book is very easy to read and understand, and the methods are simple to implement.  
    * The book is less rigorous than academic papers, but that is by design, making it more accessible to a wider audience.  
  
* **Practical Takeaways:**  
    * Start small: Break down desired behaviors into the smallest possible steps.  
    * Anchor habits to existing routines: Use triggers from your daily life to prompt new habits.  
    * Celebrate every success: Reinforce positive behaviors with immediate, genuine celebration. 🎉  
    * Focus on ability, not motivation.  
    * Iterate and adjust your tiny habits as needed.  
  
#### Book Recommendations 📚  
* **Best Alternate Book (Same Topic):** "[Atomic Habits](./atomic-habits.md)" by James Clear: While both books focus on habit formation, "Atomic Habits" offers a more comprehensive framework with a greater emphasis on identity-based habits and systems. 🔄  
* **Best Tangentially Related Book:** "[Thinking, Fast and Slow](./thinking-fast-and-slow.md)" by Daniel Kahneman: This book explores the cognitive biases that influence decision-making, providing a deeper understanding of the mental processes underlying behavior change. 🧠  
* **Best Diametrically Opposed Book:** "The Willpower Instinct" by Kelly McGonigal: While "Tiny Habits" minimizes the role of willpower, McGonigal's book emphasizes its importance and provides strategies for strengthening it. ⚔️  
* **Best Fiction Book (Related Ideas):** "The Martian" by Andy Weir: This book demonstrates the power of incremental problem-solving and adaptability in extreme circumstances. 🚀  
* **More General Book:** "[The Power of Habit](./the-power-of-habit.md)" by Charles Duhigg: An exploration of how habits work at the individual, organizational, and societal levels, providing a broader perspective on habit formation. 🌐  
* **More Specific Book:** "[Indistractable](./indistractable.md): How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life" by Nir Eyal: This book focuses on a specific area of habit formation: managing distractions and regaining control of your attention. 🎯  
* **More Rigorous Book:** "[Nudge](./nudge.md): Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness" by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein: This book delves into the science of choice architecture and how subtle nudges can influence behavior, providing a more academic approach to behavior change. 🤓

**Human Notes**  
## Behavior model  
### Model  
- Prompt  
    - <- {0, 1}  
    - binary variable  
    - if not prompted, behavior will not occur  
- Motivation  
    - <- [0, 1]  
    - positively correlated with likelihood of behavior  
    - motivation is fickle and can't generally be relied upon  
    -   
- Ability  
    - <- [0, 1]  
    - positively correlated with likelihood of behavior  
    - behaviors can be made easier by  
        - scaling down  
        - starter steps  
        - repetition  
  
Let B = Likelihood of behavior occurring  
B = M * A * P  
  
### Implications  
- If you want a behavior to occur  
    - ensure there is a prompt at the right place and time  
    - when motivation is low, ensure the behavior is easy  
- if you want a behavior not to occur  
    - remove the prompts when possible  
    - when motivation is high, ensure the behavior is difficult  
  
## Prompts  
### People Prompts  
- internal cues  
- examples  
    - stomach growls  
    - have to pee  
    - just remember  
- when evolutionary adapted for survival -> reliable  
- otherwise -> extremely unreliable  
### Context Prompts  
- examples  
    - alarms  
    - reminders  
    - Todo lists  
    - sticky notes  
    -   
  
### Action Prompts (anchors)  
- after I do X, I will do Y  
- behavior sequencing  
    - what comes after what?  
    - like a computer program  
    -   
  
## Celebration  
- After performing a tiny habit, celebrate.  
- Emotions create habits  
- This   
  
## Rehearsal  
Celebrate 3 times.  
When remembering to do habit  
While doing habit  
Immediately after habit
