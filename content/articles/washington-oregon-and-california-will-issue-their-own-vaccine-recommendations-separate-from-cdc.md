# 🇺🇸⛰️☀️💉 Washington, Oregon and California will issue their own vaccine recommendations, separate from CDC  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
The 🤝 West Coast Health Alliance was 🧪 formed to issue vaccine recommendations separate from the CDC.  
  
- A new alliance was created by governors to provide 🧬 **evidence-based**, unified recommendations.  
- The alliance was formed in direct response to a new CDC committee that revised the 💉 COVID-19 vaccine recommendation, limiting it to seniors who are most at risk.  
- The governors stated that the politicization of the CDC is a direct 💥 assault on the health and safety of the American people.  
- The states will begin to coordinate health guidelines by 🗺️ aligning immunization recommendations with *respected* national medical organizations.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
The 🤝 **creation of the West Coast Health Alliance** is a direct 👎 **rebuke** of the CDC, with the governors explicitly stating their belief that the federal agency has become a political tool 🧑‍⚖️ that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science 🧪. This framing highlights a critical ⚠️ ideological schism 💔 in American public health: one side advocating for decisions to be made by trusted scientists 👩‍🔬 and clinicians 🩺, while the other is prioritizing political agendas 📣 and challenging long-held scientific consensus 🤔.  
  
For a better understanding, it would be beneficial to explore:  
- 💡 the full context of Robert F. Kennedy's views  
- 🏛️ politicization within the CDC's recent actions  
- 🐘 counter-arguments from the Trump administration  
- 🏥 the public and professional medical community's reactions to this new alliance
