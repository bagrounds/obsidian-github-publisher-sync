# 🇺🇸✂️🩺🤕 States face hard choices after major cuts to federal health care funding

## 🤖 AI Summary  
- **Existing and Looming Cuts:** Some states 🗺️ are already grappling with cuts, such as the Trump administration's decision to claw back $11 billion in pandemic-related funding 💰, while also preparing for the looming, near-trillion-dollar reduction in Medicaid spending 📉 expected in the coming years.  
- **Impact on States:** The impact 💥 varies by state; for example, Texas is projected to lose around $40 billion in Medicaid funding 📉, while Delaware has already seen about $40 million in public health fund cuts 💰. States face a difficult financial situation 💸 because these cuts are happening at a time when many have already reduced their revenue by offering tax breaks to residents 🏡.  
- **Work Requirements:** The "Big Beautiful Bill Act" includes a work requirement 💼 for enrollees, which is a major concern 🤔 for states. There are worries 😥 that this new layer of bureaucracy and paperwork ✍️ will cause many people to drop off the enrollment rolls.  
- **Wider Consequences:** The funding cuts ✂️ are not expected to only affect Medicaid enrollees. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the number of uninsured people 🧑 could increase by more than 7 million \[[04:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9kSyaU2aQo&t=263)]. This rise in uninsured individuals could lead to higher uncompensated care costs 💵 for hospitals, which might cause premiums to rise for everyone with private or employer-sponsored insurance to cover the gap.
