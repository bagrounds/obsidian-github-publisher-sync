## 🏋️ Coding Practice  
### [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array)  
> Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears only **once**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**. Then return _the number of unique elements in_ `nums`.  
> Consider the number of unique elements of `nums` to be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:  
> - Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the unique elements in the order they were present in `nums` initially. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.  
> - Return `k`.  
  
#### 🪞 Reflections  
1. < 14 minutes is good  
2. no bugs is pretty good  
3. the test case may have been a bit longer than necessary, but it got the coverage we needed and we finished in time  
4. testing gave confidence in the correct code  
5. I remember [planning this problem](./2024-06-13.md#26remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array) in the past without coding the solution  
    1. I didn't reference my old planning notes, but I did remember the approach  
    2. Planning took about the same amount of time this time as it did last time  
  
#### ⌨️ My Solution  
```ts  
/* Remove duplicates from sorted array, sliding k unique elements to the front, return k  
Plan  
1. Use 2 pointers: 1 for reading and 1 for writing  
2. Scan from left to right, advancing the reading cursor to skip duplicates but advancing the writing cursor to write them  
3. track length with a uniques counter  
runtime complexity: O(N)  
extra space complexity: O(1)  
[03:41] done planning  
[08:12] done with initial implementation  
[13:17] done with test (no bugs found)  
[13:48] success on first submission

function removeDuplicates(nums: number[]): number { // [1,1,2,2,2,3]  
  let uniqueCount: number = 0

    if (unique) {  
      uniqueCount++ // 3; 2; 1  
      nums[w] = currentValue // [1,2,3,2,2,3]; [1,2,2,2,2,3]; [1,1,2,2,2,3]  
      w++ // 3; 2; 1  
    }  
  }  
  return uniqueCount // 3
