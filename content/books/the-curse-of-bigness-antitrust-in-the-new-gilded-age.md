📖 Excessive corporate concentration threatens democracy and economic freedom. We should return to robust antitrust enforcement reminiscent of the Progressive Era.  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
### 🤔 Core Philosophy  
* 😈 **Bigness is a Curse:** Concentrated private power, beyond mere monopoly, inherently harms democracy and economic liberty.  
* ⚖️ **Antitrust's Dual Purpose:** Antitrust laws serve both economic and political goals, not solely consumer welfare. They protect against the political influence of large corporations and foster a healthy competitive environment.  
* 📜 **Historical Precedent:** The Progressive Era (Theodore Roosevelt, Louis Brandeis) successfully used antitrust to curb corporate power, lessons lost in recent decades.  
* 🏢 **Modern Gilded Age:** Current corporate concentration, particularly in tech, mirrors the first Gilded Age, requiring similar forceful intervention.  
  
### ✅ Actionable Steps (Policy Recommendations)  
* 🎯 **Shift Antitrust Focus:** Move away from the narrow consumer welfare standard (Chicago School) to a broader protecting competition and limiting corporate power framework.  
* 💪 **Vigorous Enforcement:** Implement more substantial antitrust cases, including structural breakups of dominant firms.  
* 🚫 **Prohibit Concentrated Mergers:** Automatically ban mergers leading to excessive market concentration, irrespective of immediate consumer pricing effects.  
* 🕵️‍♀️ **Market Investigations:** Institute automatic investigations for industries dominated by single companies for extended periods (e.g., ten years or more).  
* 🏛️ **Reassert Governmental Role:** Governments must actively control economic structure to prevent it from controlling society.  
* 🇪🇺 **Learn from Europe:** Consider European approaches to scrutinizing big tech companies.  
  
## ⚖️ Evaluation  
  
* 📖 **Historical Context is Strong:** Wu provides a compelling historical narrative of antitrust law, tracing its evolution from the Gilded Age through the Progressive Era and its subsequent decline. The connections drawn between historical trusts and modern tech giants are widely praised as insightful.  
* 🗣️ **Critique of Consumer Welfare Standard Resonates:** The book's central argument challenging the sole focus on consumer welfare in antitrust, popularized by the Chicago School, is a significant point of contemporary debate and finds support among progressive antitrust advocates. This perspective argues that the narrow focus overlooks broader societal and democratic harms of concentrated power.  
* 💡 **Conciseness as a Strength:** Many reviewers highlight the book's brevity and accessible style, making complex legal and economic concepts understandable to a broad audience. This allows for a snorkle dip into the topic rather than an impenetrable deep dive.  
* 🚨 **Call for Action is Timely:** Wu's urgent call for renewed antitrust enforcement resonates in an era of increasing corporate concentration and concerns about the power of tech monopolies. His influence is noted within discussions about new antitrust approaches at regulatory agencies.  
* 🤫 **Understated Roosevelt's Hard-Nosed Attitude:** One review wished for more assertive advocacy, suggesting that while the historical background on Brandeis is important, the modern implications and calls to action could be more forcefully integrated into the narrative.
