### 🚀 3 High Leverage Career Skills  
#### 🥇 1. Start a Brag Document  
📝 Make a text document you can access from anywhere.  
✍️ Every time you do something impactful, write a paragraph with details about when it happened, when it happened, and who was involved.  
  
✨ This is high leverage because it takes very little time to record, yet you keep the reference forever. 📚 You now have plenty of stories for resumes, interviews, promotions, and performance reviews.  
  
🚫 Don't record anything that isn't noteworthy, impactful, or can be easily looked up.  
  
#### 🗣️ 2. Get and Stay Good at Interviewing  
👂 Active listening is key to being a good interviewer and a good listener.  
  
#### 🙅‍♀️ 3. Learn when to say no  
🛑 Get better at saying no by understanding when you should say yes.  
⛔ You need to say no more.  
📉 Because most work is not impactful.  
  
❌ Say no 10x more than when you say yes.  
  
✅ Say yes when  
1. ➕ There's an outsized benefit to saying yes vs the effort you put in.  
2. ❤️ If there's big benefit for the person who's asking  
3. ⌚ If you have the bandwidth and it's really easy. Use sparingly.  
  
🚀 When there's high impact for you or others.  
🏆 Can you add it to your brag document? Say yes.
