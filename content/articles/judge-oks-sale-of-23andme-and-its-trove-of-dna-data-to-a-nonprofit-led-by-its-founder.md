# 🧑‍⚖️🧬💰🤝 Judge OKs sale of 23andMe - and its trove of DNA data - to a nonprofit led by its founder  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* ⚖️ A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of 23andMe for 💰 $305 million to TTAM Research Group, led by former CEO and co-founder 👩‍🔬 Anne Wojcicki.  
* 🤝 The new buyer, TTAM Research Group, is a nonprofit that will continue the company's mission of 🧬 understanding the human genome for the public good.  
* ✅ TTAM has committed to abiding by existing privacy policies, 🛡️ implementing further protections and privacy safeguards, and 📧 notifying customers in advance of the deal's closure.  
* 🧑‍⚖️ A consumer privacy board will be established within 90 days of the deal's closure, and 🔒 new privacy procedures will be adopted, including notifying customers of material changes, mitigating data breaches, and submitting annual reports to state attorneys general if required.  
* 💳 Customers will also be offered two years of complimentary identity theft monitoring services.  
* 🏛️ Prior to the sale, 27 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to block the sale of personal genetic data without customer consent, arguing that 🩸 biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without explicit, informed consent.  
* 🚨 There were previous privacy issues, including a 💻 hack in 2023 that exposed the personal data of nearly 7 million 23andMe customers over a five-month period.  
* ⚙️ 23andMe was found to have failed to implement appropriate controls for accessing raw genetic data and had ineffective systems for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats.  
* 📜 The company's privacy policy stated that it would not sell, lease, or rent individual-level information to a third party for research purposes without explicit consent, but state attorneys general argue consent for sale was not obtained.  
* ⚕️ HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) does not cover genetic data collected by direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies.
