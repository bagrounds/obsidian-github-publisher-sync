## Levels  
  
  
## Story Telling  
🙉 Show; don't tell.  
❌ The STAR method isn't good for generating stories. It's too focused on what happened, and not focused enough on developing the character: you.  
### ✅ Man in a Hole  
Simplest story shape, described by [Kurt Vonnegut](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut).  
  
1. Start by anchoring the story on your status and responsibilities on a team, using terms from the job description.  
2. Layer in conflict, challenges, and obstacles.  
3. Don't over think it.  
4. Effective stories have a general U-shape  
    1. Magnitude of U signals your level  
    2. Depth of the U's dip describes the size of the problems you can deal with  
5. Use STAR to **review** the story (not to generate it) and ensure it has substance.  
6.   
  
## Don't  
1. Lie  
2. Tell someone else's story  
3. Describe villains  
4. Describe a perfect success
