# [🧠🪜⏱️📈 Hierarchical gradients of multiple timescales in the mammalian forebrain](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11665873)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
🧠 The study examines the **hierarchical gradients of multiple timescales** in the brains of different mammalian species.  
- 🔬 The research analyzed data from **monkeys, rats, and mice** performing various behavioral tasks.  
- 🕰️ Both **intrinsic and task-related timescales** of neural activity followed a similar **hierarchical gradient** in the cerebral cortex of all three species.  
- 🧬 This hierarchical organization is a **universal feature** of intracortical connections in the mammalian brain.  
- ⏳ The timescales of activity in the **thalamus** were shorter than those in the cortex and did **not conform** to the expected hierarchical pattern.  
- 🧠 The presence of diverse timescales likely **enhances the adaptability** of cortical circuits.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
- 🔬 The study provides compelling evidence that the **hierarchical gradient of timescales** is a fundamental organizational principle conserved across multiple mammalian species.  
- 💡 A potential area for further exploration is the **functional significance** of the short timescales observed in the thalamus and why this region deviates from the cortical hierarchy.  
- 🧠 Investigating how these different timescales contribute to specific cognitive functions, such as attention or memory formation, would provide a more complete understanding.  
- 🔎 Another topic to explore is whether similar hierarchical gradients exist in other brain structures, such as the cerebellum or basal ganglia, to better understand the full scope of this organizational principle.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
- 📖 **Principles of Neural Science** by Eric R. Kandel, James H. Schwartz, and Thomas M. Jessell: A comprehensive textbook for a deeper understanding of the foundational principles of neuroscience, including neural circuits and brain organization.  
- 🧠 **The Brain: The Story of You** by David Eagleman: A more accessible look at the brain's complex workings, offering a broad perspective on how neural activity gives rise to consciousness and behavior.  
- **[🤔🐇🐢 Thinking, Fast and Slow](../books/thinking-fast-and-slow.md)** by Daniel Kahneman: This book explores the two systems that drive how we think and make decisions, which relates to the concept of different processing speeds and timescales in the brain.  
- **[🧠🫂 The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience](../books/the-embodied-mind-cognitive-science-and-human-experience.md)** by Francisco Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch: A contrasting perspective that moves beyond a purely neural focus, examining how the brain, body, and environment are interconnected in shaping cognition.
