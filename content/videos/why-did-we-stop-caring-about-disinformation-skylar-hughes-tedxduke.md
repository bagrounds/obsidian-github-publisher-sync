## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
- ⚖️ The speakers focus on social norms aligns with research from the Pew Research Center, which highlights how social media echo chambers reinforce misinformation.  
- 🔍 While the video emphasizes individual courage, organizations like the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism suggest that structural changes to platform algorithms are also necessary to curb the spread of falsehoods.  
- 💡 Exploring the intersection of cognitive science and legislative policy could provide a more comprehensive view of how to combat these systemic issues.
