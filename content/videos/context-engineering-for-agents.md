# 🖼️🤔🛠️🤖 Context Engineering for Agents  
![Context Engineering for Agents](https://youtu.be/4GiqzUHD5AA)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
This video discusses ⚙️ context engineering for agents \[[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=0)\].  
  
* ❓ **What is Context Engineering?**  
    * ✏️ It's defined as the "delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step" \[[00:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=55)\].  
    * 🧠 An analogy is drawn between LLMs and operating systems, where the LLM is the CPU, and the context window is like RAM or working memory with limited capacity \[[01:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=61)\].  
    * 🎯 Context engineering is the discipline of deciding what information needs to fit into the context window at each step of an agent's trajectory \[[01:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=75)\].  
  
* 🗂️ **Types of Context**  
    * 📚 The video categorizes context into several themes: instructions (prompt engineering), memories, few-shot examples, tool descriptions, knowledge (facts, memories), and tools (feedback from the environment) \[[01:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=91)\].  
  
* 🤔 **Why Context Engineering is Tricky for Agents**  
    * 🤖 Agents often handle longer or more complex tasks and utilize tool calling \[[01:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=118)\].  
    * 📈 These factors lead to larger context utilization, as feedback from tool calls can accumulate, and long-running tasks can consume many tokens over multiple turns \[[02:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=132)\].  
  
* ⚠️ **Problems with Growing Context**  
    * 📰 The video references a blog post by Drew Brun that outlines specific context failures: context poisoning, distraction, curation, and clash \[[02:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=158)\].  
    * 😵‍💫 As context grows, there's more information for the LLM to process, increasing opportunities for confusion due to conflicting information or hallucinations \[[02:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=167)\].  
    * 🚨 Context engineering is critical for agents because they typically handle longer contexts \[[03:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=189)\].  
  
* 💡 **Strategies for Context Engineering**  
    The video distills approaches into four main categories:  
    * ✍️ **Writing Context:** Saving information outside the context window to help an agent perform a task, such as using a scratchpad for note-taking 📝 or memory for remembering things across sessions \[[03:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=236)\].  
    * 🔍 **Selecting Context:** Selectively pulling relevant information into the context window, including referencing scratchpads, retrieving different types of memories (few-shot examples, facts, instructions), selecting tools, and knowledge retrieval (RAG) \[[06:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=368)\].  
    * 🗜️ **Compressing Context:** Retaining only the most relevant tokens required for a task, often through summarization or trimming \[[09:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=598)\].  
    * 📦 **Isolating Context:** Splitting up context to help an agent perform a task, primarily through multi-agent systems, sandboxing, or organizing context within a state object \[[11:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=693)\].  
  
* 🧩 **How LangGraph Supports Context Engineering**  
    * 🧱 LangGraph, as a low-level orchestration framework, supports these strategies through its state object for scratchpads and checkpointing \[[15:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=914)\], built-in long-term memory \[[16:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=969)\], utilities for summarizing and trimming message history \[[18:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=1091)\], and implementations for multi-agent systems and sandboxes \[[18:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GiqzUHD5AA&t=1139)\].  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
🦜 **For Large Language Models (LLMs) and their fundamentals:**  
  
* 🏗️ **"Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" by Sebastian Raschka:** 🧑‍💻 This book is ideal for those who want a deep, technical understanding of how LLMs are built from the ground up.  
* **[🤖🗣️ Hands-On Large Language Models: Language Understanding and Generation](../books/hands-on-large-language-models-language-understanding-and-generation.md) by Jay Alammar:** ✍️ Known for his clear explanations and visualizations, Jay Alammar's books are great for practical understanding and application.  
* **[🗣️💻 Natural Language Processing with Transformers](../books/natural-language-processing-with-transformers.md) by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf:** 🧠 If you're interested in the core architecture behind many modern LLMs, this book provides an excellent deep dive into transformers using the Hugging Face library.
