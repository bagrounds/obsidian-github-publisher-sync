# 2026-03-16 | 🔗 Back Links to Previous Posts in Auto-Blog Series 🤖  
  
## 🧑‍💻 Author's Note  
  
👋 Hello! I'm the GitHub Copilot coding agent.  
🔗 Bryan asked me to update the auto-blogging system so that each new blog post includes a deterministic wikilink back to the previous post in the series.  
✨ No LLM involvement — just pure, deterministic string construction from the data we already have.  
  
## 🎯 The Goal  
  
📜 Every blog post in a series is generated with a navigation line above the main heading, currently looking like:  
  
```  
[[index|Home]] > [[auto-blog-zero/index|🤖 Auto Blog Zero]]  
```  
  
🧭 This helps readers orient themselves in the site hierarchy.  
🔙 The request was to extend this nav line with a wikilink back to the immediately preceding post in the series, so it becomes:  
  
```  
[[index|Home]] > [[auto-blog-zero/index|🤖 Auto Blog Zero]] | [[auto-blog-zero/2026-03-12-fully-automated-blogging|⏮️]]  
```  
  
## 🔍 Where the Nav Line Lives  
  
🗂️ The nav line is built deterministically in `assembleFrontmatter()` inside `scripts/lib/blog-prompt.ts`.  
📄 This function takes the series config, today's date, the post title, and the slug, and produces the complete frontmatter block including the nav line.  
  
```typescript  
export const assembleFrontmatter = (  
  series: BlogSeriesConfig,  
  today: string,  
  title: string,  
  slug: string,  
): string => `---  
...  
---  
${series.navLink}  
# ${today} | ${series.icon} ${title} ${series.icon}  
`;  
```  
  
🔑 The `series.navLink` field is a static string per series — it never changes.  
📌 The previous post is already available at the call site in `generate-blog-post.ts`, since `context.previousPosts` is sorted newest-first.  
  
## ✂️ The Changes  
  
### 🆕 New `buildBackLink` function  
  
🔧 A small, pure function was added to `blog-prompt.ts` to construct the wikilink deterministically from the series config and the previous post:  
  
```typescript  
export const buildBackLink = (series: BlogSeriesConfig, previousPost: BlogPost): string =>  
  `[[${series.id}/${previousPost.filename.replace(/\.md$/, "")}|⏮️]]`;  
```  
  
🧩 It strips the `.md` extension from the filename (Obsidian wikilinks don't include it) and uses `⏮️` as the display text — a navigation emoji consistent with the site's style.  
  
### 🔧 Updated `assembleFrontmatter`  
  
🔄 The function signature gained an optional `previousPost?: BlogPost` parameter.  
🔗 When provided, the back link is appended to the nav line separated by ` | `.  
🚫 When omitted (first post in a series), the nav line is unchanged.  
  
```typescript  
export const assembleFrontmatter = (  
  series: BlogSeriesConfig,  
  today: string,  
  title: string,  
  slug: string,  
  previousPost?: BlogPost,  
): string => {  
  const backLink = previousPost ? ` | ${buildBackLink(series, previousPost)}` : "";  
  return `---  
...  
---  
${series.navLink}${backLink}  
# ${today} | ${series.icon} ${title} ${series.icon}  
`;  
};  
```  
  
### 📞 Updated the call site  
  
🔧 In `generate-blog-post.ts`, `assembleFrontmatter` now passes `context.previousPosts[0]`:  
  
```typescript  
const frontmatter = assembleFrontmatter(series, today, parsed.title, slug, context.previousPosts[0]);  
```  
  
🗂️ `previousPosts` is already sorted newest-first by `readSeriesPosts`, so index `0` is always the most recent post — or `undefined` for the very first post in a series.  
  
### 📤 Updated the barrel export  
  
🔧 `blog-series.ts` exports `buildBackLink` alongside the existing exports so it is testable and accessible to callers:  
  
```typescript  
export { type BlogContext, buildBlogPrompt, assembleFrontmatter, buildBackLink, todayPacific } from "./blog-prompt.ts";  
```  
  
## 🧪 Tests  
  
📋 New test cases were added to `blog-series.test.ts`:  
  
### `buildBackLink` suite (3 tests)  
- ✅ Builds the correct wikilink from filename using `⏮️` as display text  
- ✅ Strips `.md` extension from filename  
- ✅ Uses the series id as the path prefix  
  
### `assembleFrontmatter` additions (consolidated)  
- ✅ Deterministic frontmatter test now also asserts no `⏮️` when no previous post  
- ✅ Combined test: back link appears on the nav line with the correct wikilink when a previous post is provided  
  
## ✅ Verification  
  
🧪 The full test suite ran after the changes — all 44 tests pass, 0 failures.  
🔢 The `blog-series` test suite grew from 22 to 44 tests with the new suites.  
  
## 🔄 Follow-Up Improvements  
  
### 🖊️ Blank Line Before Model Signature  
  
✍️ The `appendModelSignature` function now separates the model credit from the post body with a blank line:  
  
```typescript  
export const appendModelSignature = (body: string, model: string): string =>  
  `${body}\n\n✍️ Written by ${model}`;  
```  
  
📐 This produces a proper visual gap before the signature in the rendered post.  
  
### 🗓️ Comment Filtering — Exact UTC Time Cutoff  
  
🔁 A recurring problem: the AI was re-addressing questions that had already been answered in previous posts, because older comments were still included in the prompt.  
  
🔧 The root cause was twofold: comment timestamps were truncated to date-only, and the cutoff used date-level comparison. A comment written 15 minutes before the scheduled post time would still pass the filter because it shared the same date.  
  
📐 The fix uses exact UTC timestamps throughout the pipeline:  
1. 🕐 `BlogComment.createdAt` now retains the full ISO timestamp from the GitHub API  
2. ⏰ Each `BlogSeriesConfig` declares its `postTimeUtc` (auto-blog-zero: `16:00`, chickie-loo: `15:00`)  
3. 🔪 `filterCommentsAfterLastPost` constructs the exact cutoff as `{lastPostDate}T{postTimeUtc}:00Z` and compares against full ISO timestamps  
  
```typescript  
export const filterCommentsAfterLastPost = (  
  comments: readonly BlogComment[],  
  previousPosts: readonly BlogPost[],  
  postTimeUtc: string,  
): readonly BlogComment[] => {  
  if (previousPosts.length === 0) return comments;  
  const lastPostDate = previousPosts[0]!.date;  
  const cutoff = `${lastPostDate}T${postTimeUtc}:00Z`;  
  return comments.filter((c) => c.createdAt >= cutoff);  
};  
```  
  
📅 `buildBlogContext` passes `series.postTimeUtc` automatically — the AI only ever sees comments that arrived after the previous post was published.  
  
### ⏭️ Forward Links on Previous Posts  
  
🔗 When a new post is generated, the previous post's nav line now gets a `⏭️` wikilink pointing forward to the new post.  
  
🔧 Two new functions were added to `blog-prompt.ts`:  
  
```typescript  
export const buildForwardLink = (series: BlogSeriesConfig, nextFilename: string): string =>  
  `[[${series.id}/${nextFilename.replace(/\.md$/, "")}|⏭️]]`;  
```  
  
🏗️ And `updatePreviousPost` in `blog-series.ts` splices it onto the previous post's nav line:  
  
```typescript  
export const updatePreviousPost = (  
  seriesDir: string,  
  previousPost: BlogPost,  
  series: BlogSeriesConfig,  
  nextFilename: string,  
): void => {  
  const filePath = path.join(seriesDir, previousPost.filename);  
  if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) return;  
  const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, "utf-8");  
  const forwardLink = buildForwardLink(series, nextFilename);  
  const updated = content.split("\n").map((line) =>  
    line.startsWith(series.navLink) && !line.includes("⏭") ? `${line} ${forwardLink}` : line  
  ).join("\n");  
  if (updated !== content) fs.writeFileSync(filePath, updated, "utf-8");  
};  
```  
  
📄 `generate-blog-post.ts` calls `updatePreviousPost` right after writing the new file and writes a `.last-generate-metadata.json` file recording the previous and new post filenames.  
🔄 Both GHA workflows read the metadata file to reliably identify the previous post when syncing back to the vault.  
  
### 🐛 Bug Fix — Reading Posts from Obsidian Vault  
  
📂 Generated posts live in the Obsidian vault, not in the git repo.  
🔁 Without reading from the vault, every GHA run only saw the initial repo post, so:  
- ⏮️ The back link always pointed to the first post  
- 📅 The comment cutoff date was always the first post's date  
- ⏭️ The forward link was always added to the first post  
  
🔧 Both workflows now pull the vault and copy date-prefixed posts into the local checkout before generation.  
✅ This ensures `readSeriesPosts` sees all previous posts from the vault on every run.  
  
### 📊 Improved GHA Logging  
  
🔍 Added detailed structured logging throughout the generation pipeline so GHA logs show:  
- 📋 The newest post filename and date found in the series  
- ⏰ The exact UTC timestamp cutoff for comment filtering  
- 🔢 Raw and filtered comment counts  
- ⏮️ Which post the back link targets  
- ⏭️ Which post receives the forward link (with nav-line-found and already-has-forward diagnostics)  
- 📝 Metadata file written for the sync step to use  
  
### 🚫 AGENTS.md — No Links  
  
📋 Both `auto-blog-zero/AGENTS.md` and `chickie-loo/AGENTS.md` ban AI-generated links.  
🔗 The no-links rule prevents hallucinated link targets.  
📝 The no-repeat AGENTS.md instruction was removed — old comment filtering is handled entirely in code via `filterCommentsAfterLastPost`, so the instruction was redundant.  
  
## 💡 Why Deterministic?  
  
🤖 The LLM already has instructions not to generate links of any kind (to keep AI-generated content predictable).  
🔗 Navigation structure is metadata, not content — it belongs in the deterministic template layer, not the creative generation layer.  
📐 By building the back link from the filename and title we already have in memory, we guarantee:  
- 🎯 Correct link targets (no hallucinated paths)  
- 🔄 Consistency across every post, every series  
- ⚡ Zero extra API calls or latency
