# The Righteous Mind  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### TLDR  
🤔 Human morality is built on 🧠 evolved psychological foundations that 🧍 vary across individuals and 🤝 political groups, leading to 💔 deep divisions rooted in 🧭 differing moral intuitions rather than 💡 solely in reason or 📰 facts.  
  
### Deep Dive 🧠  
⚖️ Jonathan Haidt's "The Righteous Mind" ⚖️ delves into the 🧠 psychological origins of morality 🤔 and its role in ➡️ political 🏛️ and religious 🙏 divisions. He argues that 🗣️ moral 😇 reasoning is often ⏰ post-hoc rationalization of pre-existing moral 🤔 intuitions, rather than a purely logical 💡 process.  
  
#### **📚 Topics and Methods:**  
* **🧱 Moral Foundations Theory:** 👨‍🏫 Haidt proposes six (originally five) foundational moral values:  
    * 🩹 Care/Harm  
    * ⚖️ Fairness/Cheating  
    * 🤝 Loyalty/Betrayal  
    * 👑 Authority/Subversion  
    * ⛪️ Sanctity/Degradation  
    * 🗽 Liberty/Oppression (added later)  
* **🐘 The Elephant and the Rider:** 🐴 Haidt uses this metaphor to illustrate the relationship between intuition (the elephant 🐘) and reason (the rider 🧑‍💼). The elephant 🐘 represents our automatic, emotional responses 😭😠😡, while the rider 🧑‍💼 is our conscious, rational mind 🤔. The rider 🧑‍💼 often serves to justify the elephant's 🐘 actions.  
* **🧠 Moral Intuitions First, Strategic Reasoning Second:** 🎯 Haidt argues that moral judgments are primarily driven by gut feelings and intuitions 😲, with reasoning coming later to support those judgments 🧐.  
* **👥 Groupishness:** 🐝 Haidt examines the evolutionary origins of morality 🐒, emphasizing its role in promoting cooperation and cohesion within groups 🤝. He explores how humans are "90% chimp 🐒 and 10% bee 🐝," meaning we are both individualistic 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ and group-oriented 🧑‍🤝‍🧑.  
* **🌍 Cultural Psychology:** 🗺️ Haidt draws on cross-cultural studies to demonstrate the variability of moral values across different societies 🏘️.

* 🧩 He synthesizes findings from 📈 studies on moral development, 👥 social psychology, and 🧠 neuroscience.  
* 🌳 The book is grounded in 🧬 evolutionary psychology, suggesting that 🤔 moral intuitions are ⚙️ adaptations that evolved to solve specific 🤝 social problems.
