*Harbingers: What January 6 and Charlottesville Reveal About Rising Threats to American Democracy* ✍️ by Timothy J. Heaphy offers a penetrating look at two pivotal events in recent American history through the eyes of a lead investigator. Drawing on his experience overseeing inquiries into both the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville ✊ and the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol 🏛️, Heaphy connects these seemingly disparate events as indicators, or "harbingers," of escalating 🚨 threats to the foundations of American democracy.  
  
### 🔑 Key Themes and Content  
  
The book delves into the underlying factors that contributed to the violence 💥 and instability witnessed in Charlottesville and on January 6th. Heaphy provides an insider's account 🗣️ of the investigations, detailing the process of gathering evidence 🔍, interviewing individuals involved (from planners to bystanders), and navigating the political landscape surrounding these events.

* 🌐 **Misinformation and Isolation:** The book examines the role of misinformation and the isolation of individuals within information bubbles 💬 as contributing factors to radicalization and distrust.

* ⚖️ **Accountability and Deterrence:** The book underscores the importance of criminal and civil penalties for perpetrators as a means of deterring future attacks.  
  
Heaphy structures the narrative by taking readers through the investigative process, offering a unique perspective 👓 gained from his direct involvement.
