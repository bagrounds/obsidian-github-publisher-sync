* 📉 Trump and his circle adopt a worldview reminiscent of 1930s European authoritarianism to maintain power as their popularity slips. \[[02:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbCiS39Q6Rw&t=148)]

* 🌍 While the US may be stepping back as a global hegemon, this provides an opportunity to reconceive the nation for 21st-century crises like climate change. \[[30:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbCiS39Q6Rw&t=1830)]  
* 🧠 The president exhibits behavior suggesting a descent into childish narcissism and a lack of respect for the office's historical weight. \[[39:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbCiS39Q6Rw&t=2342)]
