## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
✍️ Elowen gripped her pen, knuckles white against the marble dust. 📻 On the desk, the radio spat policy like gravel. 🏛️ Above, a crack spiderwebbed across the Great Hall’s ceiling. 🏗️ In the street, the wrecking ball groaned, a rhythmic heartbeat swinging for the library’s foundations. 👐 She looked at her shaking hands. 🗝️ She was the last one who knew where the keys were buried. 📜 She began to scrawl, praying ink would outlast stone.  
  
🌫️ Dust tasted of limestone and old glue. 🌦️ The radio voice turned smooth, pivoting to weather as the east wing folded. 💎 Elowen didn't look up when the stained glass shattered; she merely tucked a stray hair behind a chalk-smudged ear. 🦷 The vibration thrummed in her teeth. 🖋️ Her nib caught, splattering a black bruise across the word *Magna*. 🌑 The crane’s shadow swallowed her desk.  
  
🏚️ The floorboards tilted toward the void. 📢 Outside, a loudspeaker droned new articles of state over the scream of tearing timber. 📕 Elowen slammed the ledger shut, a millennium of weight vibrating in her palms. ⚪ Plaster rained down, veiling her in white powder. 🕳️ She clawed at a loose plank, fingers finding the cold silver cylinder just as the ceiling roared into its final descent.  
  
⚓ The iron ball settled. 🔑 No sirens followed - only the chirp of a keyless remote. 📱 A young couple stepped through the rubble, checking phones and gesturing toward the waterfront view. 🗺️ They stepped over the vellum as if it were a greasy napkin, debating floor plans for the new lofts. 👤 Elowen looked from the charter to their smooth, vacant faces. 🗑️ She didn't hide the cylinder; she let it slip from her fingers into the rising trash.
