## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* 🎯 Narrow general topics into specific, answerable research questions to improve literature search outcomes.  
* 🗺️ Begin the literature hunt with recent reviews or classic papers to identify foundational knowledge nodes.  
* 🔗 Use citation tracing, both backward and forward, to build a comprehensive knowledge network.  
* 🕵️ Audit sources for funding biases, objective tone, and alignment between headlines and actual data.  
* 🐁 Distinguish between human results and animal studies to avoid overgeneralizing scientific findings.  
* 📉 Recognize that most neuroscience research identifies correlation rather than direct causation.  
* 🧱 Treat research sessions like a personal university course with dedicated times and structured documentation.  
* 📓 Document questions from a novice perspective before they are lost to increasing expertise.  
* 🛠️ Consolidate learning by transforming gathered information into creative outputs like essays or blog posts.  
* 📈 Maintain momentum by ending each session with a clear next step and unresolved questions.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* 🔬 Charlotte Fraza emphasizes a structured, academic approach similar to the methods described in The Craft of Research by the University of Chicago Press.  
* 🏛️ While Fraza focuses on digital tools like Zotero and Research Rabbit, traditional scholarly advice often places more weight on physical archives and library science expertise for non-STEM fields.  
* ⚖️ Her focus on bias detection aligns with the Media Bias Chart by Ad Fontes Media, which encourages checking source reliability and intent.  
* 🔍 To gain a deeper understanding, explore the Replication Crisis in social sciences to see why even peer-reviewed research sometimes fails.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### ❓ Q: How do I narrow down a research topic?  
  
🎯 A: Start with a broad interest and add layers of constraints until it becomes a specific question with a clear answer.  
  
### ❓ Q: How can I tell if a research paper is biased?  
  
💰 A: Investigate the funding sources, evaluate if the tone remains objective, and check if the data actually supports the headline claims.  
  
### ❓ Q: Why is active learning better than passive reading?  
  
🧠 A: Active retrieval, such as teaching or writing, forces the brain to consolidate information and identifies gaps in understanding.
