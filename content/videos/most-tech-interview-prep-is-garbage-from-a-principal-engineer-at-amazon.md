# 🗑️👩‍💻👎 Most Tech Interview Prep is GARBAGE  
![Most Tech Interview Prep is GARBAGE. (From a Principal Engineer at Amazon)](https://youtu.be/0Z9RW_hhUT4)  
## 💡 What's Wrong with Most Advice?  
👶 It's aimed at entry & junior level positions.  
👨‍💻 Don't spend all of your time on LeetCode.  
## 🏛️ Modern interview theory  
⏱️ Companies have a maximum of 6 hours to evaluate a candidate. This is not enough.  
  
1. 🔎 Without sufficient time to evaluate real skills, proxies must be used instead.  
2. 🎭 Proxies should be very difficult to imitate.  
  
⌨️ Coding is necessary, but not sufficient.  
  
👴 For senior positions, companies are looking for applicants who can contribute meaningfully to projects that will take many people years to complete.  
  
📚 The best proxies for system design & leadership are stories of past experiences building big systems and leading teams of engineers.  
  
## 🗣️ Interview Phases  
1. 💻 Coding  
2. ⚙️ System Design  
3. 🤝 Leadership  
  
## 🎭 Behavioral vs Situational  
⚙️ System design questions are behavioral questions disguised as situational questions.  
  
❓ Situational: what would you do in this situation?  
  
🗣️ Behavioral: tell me about a time when you were in this situation and tell me exactly what you did.  
  
🔍 System design questions aim to discover whether you've built systems like this in the past.  
  
## ❓ Example System Design Follow-up Questions  
- 🌐 How can it be scaled to billions of users?  
- ⏳ How would you ensure uptime & resiliency?  
- 🚀 How do you ensure it's fast in the presence of massive amounts of globally distributed data?  
  
## 🤝 Leadership: Good & Bad Example Answers  
🗣️ Tell me about a time you disagreed strongly with your team.  
  
❌ ⌨️ Tabs vs spaces  
✅ 🧪 Refactoring for testability vs ⏰ speed of delivery for deadlines.  
❌ 📟 Emacs vs VI  
✅ 🔄 Migrating to an async API to systematically eliminate operational problems vs 🧩 focusing on solving those short term problems  
✅ ⬇️ Low level vs ⬆️ high level API designs  
  
## ⚙️ How to Prepare  
⏱️ Allocate your preparation time according to the level of position you're targeting.  
  
| Level     | Coding | Design | Behavioral |  
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |  
| Entry     | 90%    | 0%     | 10%        |  
| Junior    | 75%    | 0%     | 25%        |  
| Mid       | 40%    | 20%    | 40%        |  
| Senior    | 30%    | 30%    | 40%        |  
| Principal | 20%    | 40%    | 40%        |
