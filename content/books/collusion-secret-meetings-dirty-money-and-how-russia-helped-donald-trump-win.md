* ✍️ **Narrative Construction:** 📚 The book synthesizes a large volume of information from diverse sources, including public records, leaked documents, and interviews, into a chronological and often suspenseful account of the "Trump-Russia" story.  
  
### ✍️ Author's Approach  
  
🌍 Luke Harding, a seasoned foreign correspondent for *The Guardian* who was previously expelled from Russia, brings his expertise on the country and its political and security landscape to the subject. His approach is that of an investigative reporter assembling the available evidence to make a case for 🇷🇺 Russian interference and potential collusion.  
  
### ❗ Significance  
  
"Collusion" became a *New York Times* bestseller and played a role in shaping public understanding and debate around the allegations of Russian interference in the 🇺🇸 2016 US election and the subsequent Special Counsel investigation led by ⚖️ Robert Mueller. It served to consolidate complex details into a more accessible format for a broad readership.  
  
### 🤔 Critique  
  
Critics have noted that while the book presents a compelling case based on circumstantial evidence, it does not provide conclusive proof of a formal, explicit agreement to "collude" between the Trump campaign and the 🇷🇺 Russian government. Some readers also found the extensive list of individuals involved challenging to track.
