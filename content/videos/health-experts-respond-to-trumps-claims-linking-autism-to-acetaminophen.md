# ⚕️🗣️💊 Health experts respond to Trump's claims linking autism to acetaminophen  
![Health experts respond to Trump's claims linking autism to acetaminophen](https://youtu.be/dTItqH0WsWY)  
  
## 🤖 **AI Summary**  
  
* President 🇺🇸 Trump tied the use of the drug **acetaminophen** (Tylenol) during pregnancy to **autism** \[[00:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=2)].  
* The 💡 president stated that the **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)** will begin advising women that acetaminophen can be associated with autism \[[00:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=13)].  
* The recommendation suggests women **limit Tylenol use during pregnancy** unless medically necessary \[[00:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=38)].  
* Trump asserted his unfounded opinion that taking 💊 Tylenol is not good, and pregnant women should **cope without it**, only using it for cases of **extremely high fever** that cannot be "toughed out" \[[00:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=48)].  
* The 🏥 president and health team also suggested that a cancer drug known as **leucovorin** is a potential **treatment for autism** \[[01:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=66)].  
* The 📝 FDA says it will make leucovorin tablets available to some autistic patients \[[01:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=83)].  
* Scientific 🔬 studies conducted so far **do not support** the idea that Tylenol causes autism \[[02:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=169)].  
* Two 🔢 very large studies using **sibling control** did not see an association between acetaminophen and autism \[[02:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=174)].  
* Warnings 🛑 for women to tough it out to prevent autism are **completely unwarranted** \[[03:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=195)].  
* The 🔎 administration's referenced study was **very small**, and it didn't even measure acetaminophen exposure during pregnancy \[[03:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=220)].  
* Fever 🔥 can be **detrimental** during pregnancy, and simply telling women to avoid the drug is **not nuanced, evidence-based advice** \[[04:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=257)].  
* More 🧐 rigorous studies done on the relationship between Tylenol during pregnancy and autism basically said there **was not a strong link** \[[06:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=399)].  
* The 🐴 president likened the amount of **vaccines** given to children to what is given to a **horse** \[[07:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=435)].  
* **Vaccines** have been the **number one most studied environmental factor** in the causes of autism \[[07:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=469)].  
* There has been **no credible evidence** linking vaccines to autism \[[08:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=483)].  
* The 📅 vaccine schedule already **separates and spreads out** antigens over the course of 4-5 years \[[08:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=502)].  
* There is **absolutely no safety data** on **leucovorin** in children with autism \[[09:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=549)].  
* Small, **unreplicated studies** are not enough to make a **blanket recommendation** about treating such a complex condition with a single thing \[[09:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=569)].  
  
## 🤔 **Evaluation**  
  
* The 📈 video presents a sharp contrast between the **administration's public health claims** and the **established scientific consensus**.  
* The 🔬 scientific perspective, represented by the **Autism Science Foundation** and an **epidemiologist**, directly counters the Tylenol/autism link, citing **large-scale studies** like those utilizing sibling controls that show no association \[[02:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=169)].  
* The **administration's evidence** is portrayed as based on **cherry-picking low-quality data**—specifically a small study that didn't even properly measure prenatal exposure \[[03:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=220)].  
* From a clinical standpoint, the advice to **"tough it out"** on fever is deemed irresponsible because **untreated fever** in pregnancy can itself be detrimental to the fetus, an established medical risk that contrasts with the unproven risk of acetaminophen \[[04:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=257)].  
* The claims regarding vaccines are noted as **repeatedly debunked** assertions that ignore decades of research confirming **no credible link** between vaccines and autism \[[07:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=469)].  
* The promotion of **leucovorin** is flagged as premature and potentially dangerous, as there is **no safety data** for the drug in children with autism, and the initial studies are **small and unreplicated** \[[09:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTItqH0WsWY&t=549)].  
  
**Topics to Explore for a Better Understanding:**  
  
* Investigate 🧐 the specific **risks associated with untreated high fever** and inflammation during different trimesters of pregnancy.  
* Examine 📝 the official **FDA guidelines** regarding acetaminophen use during pregnancy before and after the press conference to track any official changes.  
* Research 🧪 the **preclinical and clinical studies** on leucovorin in autism to understand the purported mechanism of action, such as the folate pathway link, that motivated the suggestion.
