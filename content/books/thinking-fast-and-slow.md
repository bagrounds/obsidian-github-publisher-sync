## 🤖 AI Summary  
### 🏆 Daniel Kahneman's Decision-Making Strategy: The Cheat Sheet  
  
#### 🧠 The Dual-System Framework (Core Philosophy)  
  
* ⚡️ **System 1: The "Fast" Thinker**  
    * 🏃 **Automatic & Effortless:** Operates automatically, quickly, and with no sense of voluntary control.  
    * 🤩 **Intuitive & Emotional:** Source of impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings.  
    * 🌍 **Constantly Active:** Creates a coherent model of the world; the "hero" of mental life.  
    * 💥 **Prone to Biases:** Jumps to conclusions; has little knowledge of logic or statistics.  
    * 💡 *Examples:* Driving on an empty road, solving $2+2$, sensing hostility.  
  
* 🐢 **System ⏳ System 2: The "Slow" Thinker**  
    * 🤔 **Effortful & Deliberate:** Requires conscious attention and mental effort.  
    * ⚖️ **Logical & Calculating:** Deals with complex computations, reasoning, and analysis.  
    * 🛋️ **The Lazy Controller:** Monitors and controls System 1's suggestions, but is often lazy.  
    * 🛑 **Role of Self-Control:** Overcomes System 1 impulses; maintains focus.  
    * 💡 *Examples:* Multiplying $17 \times 24$, parking in a tight space, comparing complex options.  
  
#### 🗂️ Major Heuristics and Biases (System 1's Flaws)  
  
* ⚓️ **Anchoring Effect:**  
    * 🔢 Initial piece of information ("the anchor") heavily sways subsequent judgments, even if irrelevant.  
    * ➡️ *Action:* Consider a wide range of information, not just the first number presented.  
* 📰 **Availability Heuristic:**  
    * 💡 Events easily recalled (vivid, recent, emotional) are judged as more probable or frequent.  
    * 📊 *Action:* Use actual statistics and base rates, not just ease of memory/news coverage.  
* 📉 **Loss Aversion & Prospect Theory:**  
    * 😭 The pain of a loss is psychologically about twice as powerful as the pleasure of an equivalent gain.  
    * 🎲 People prefer sure gains and seek risk to avoid certain losses.  
* 🖼️ **Framing Effect:**  
    * 🗣️ The way information is presented (e.g., "90% success" vs. "10% failure") changes preference, even if objective facts are identical.  
    * 🔄 *Action:* Reframe choices in multiple ways (positive and negative) before deciding.  
* 🙈 **What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI):**  
    * 🧩 System 1 constructs a coherent story only from the information available, ignoring what it doesn't know.  
    * 🧐 Leads to overconfidence and jumping to conclusions.  
    * 🔎 *Action:* Actively seek out missing or disconfirming information.  
* ❓ **SUBSTITUTION / Answering an Easier Question:**  
    * 🛣️ When faced with a hard question (Target Question), System 1 answers an easier, related one (Heuristic Question), without noticing the switch.  
    * 💰 *Example:* Target: "Should I invest?" $\rightarrow$ Heuristic: "Do I *feel* confident about this idea?"  
  
#### 🛠️ Actionable Steps for Better Decisions  
  
* 📋 **Use a Checklist/Process:**  
    * 📈 For high-stakes decisions, force System 2 engagement.  
    * ✅ Use checklists before finalizing to ensure all dimensions are considered.  
* 🔭 **Seek an "Outside View":**  
    * 📊 Combat the planning fallacy and overconfidence by looking at outcomes for similar projects/people (reference class).  
    * 🚫 Ignore your unique, optimistic "Inside View."  
* 💀 **Conduct a Pre-mortem:**  
    * 🔮 Before a decision is final, imagine it has failed spectacularly one year from now.  
    * ✍️ Write a short history of that failure; this legitimizes doubts and uncovers hidden risks.  
* 😈 **Appoint a Devil's Advocate:**  
    * 💬 Formalize the role of someone challenging the dominant intuitive view.  
    * ⌚️ Engage System 2's critical oversight *before* commitment.  
* 💯 **Anchor on Base Rates:**  
    * 🔢 Always start your probability estimate with the relevant statistical base rate.  
    * 🤏 Adjust this anchor only slightly based on specific, high-quality evidence.  
  
#### 👤 The Two Selves  
  
* 🎭 **The Experiencing Self:**  
    * 🎁 Lives in the moment; registers happiness and pain as it happens.  
    * ⏱️ The duration of an experience is important to this self.  
* 📸 **The Remembering Self:**  
    * 💯 Keeps score; constructs the story of life; makes future decisions.  
    * 🏔️ Governed by the **Peak-End Rule**: memories are determined by the most intense moment (peak) and the end of the event.  
    * 🤔 The Remembering Self is often a poor guide for the Experiencing Self's well-being.  
* 🔑 **Real Happiness:** Focus should be on time spent in flow, with loved ones, and free of pain/stress (i.e., improving the Experiencing Self's day-to-day quality).
