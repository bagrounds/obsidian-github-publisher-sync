# ⚙️🧠🔄 Adaptive Control  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
**High-Level Summary:**  
  
Adaptive Control is a branch of control theory that deals with systems whose parameters are uncertain or vary with time. ⏳ It's like teaching a robot to learn and adjust its behavior in real-time, even when the environment or the robot itself changes! 🧠 The core goal is to maintain desired system performance (stability, tracking, etc.) despite these uncertainties. 🎯 Adaptive controllers continuously monitor the system's behavior and adjust their control parameters accordingly, "adapting" to the changes. This is crucial in applications where precise models are difficult to obtain or when systems operate in dynamic environments. 🚀  
  
**Subcategories:**  
  
Here are some major subcategories of Adaptive Control:  
  
* **Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC):** 📝 This approach aims to make the closed-loop system behave like a predefined "reference model." 📖 The controller adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between the actual system output and the desired output of the reference model. It's like having a template for perfect behavior and constantly tweaking the system to match it. 📐  
* **Self-Tuning Regulators (STR):** 🔧 These controllers estimate the unknown system parameters online and use these estimates to design or tune the controller. ⚙️ It's like having a self-adjusting wrench that automatically fits the right size. 🔩  
* **Gain Scheduling:** 📈 This technique uses pre-computed control parameters for different operating conditions. 📊 When the system moves from one condition to another, the controller switches to the appropriate set of parameters. It's like having a set of pre-programmed maps for different terrains. 🗺️  
* **Dual Adaptive Control:** 🧐 This method considers both the control objective and the need to improve the parameter estimates. 🔍 It balances the exploration of unknown parameters with the exploitation of current knowledge. It's like a smart explorer who both tries to find the right path and learns about the terrain along the way. 🧭  
* **[Reinforcement Learning based Adaptive Control](./reinforcement-learning-based-adaptive-control.md):** 🎮 This method uses reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal control policies in uncertain environments. 🕹️ The controller learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions and penalties for bad ones. It is very useful for very complex and non-linear systems. 🏆
