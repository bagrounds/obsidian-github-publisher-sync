# 🇺🇸🗣️👑 Senator Slotkin Delivers Speech on Trump's Authoritarian Playbook  
![Senator Slotkin Delivers Speech on Trump's Authoritarian Playbook](https://youtu.be/fnUO0Plcpbo)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
Senator Elissa Slotkin outlined her belief that President Donald Trump is 📖 following an authoritarian playbook to permanently keep power \[[09:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=593)]. The 🇺🇸 national security apparatus is being redirected to focus on a domestic enemy within \[[05:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=320)], with force increasingly aimed at American citizens.  
  
* 🚢 The administration announced lethal strikes on 14 ships in the Caribbean and has killed 57 people \[[03:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=207)].  
* ❓ The administration refuses to provide Congress with the names of the cartels being fought or the Justice Department's legal memo justifying these strikes \[[04:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=244)].  
* ⚖️ This represents an unprecedented use of force, unlike the Global War on Terror where Congress knew the names of targeted groups and the legal justification \[[04:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=298)].  
* 📝 An executive order directed the Justice Department to create a secret list of domestic terrorist organizations \[[05:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=337)], broadly defined as groups accused of anti-Americanism or hostility towards traditional American views \[[05:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=345)].  
* 🛑 These groups do not have to be violent to be added to the list \[[06:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=364)], which could lead to American citizens being wiretapped, searched, or arrested for simply disagreeing with the president's agenda \[[06:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=415)].  
* 🧠 Trump created weaponization working groups that include the intelligence community to target perceived enemies, shifting the US toward a modern-day surveillance state \[[07:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=445)].  
* 💂 He has attempted to deploy over 7,000 National Guard members to five American cities \[[08:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=486)] and created new Guard units focused on quelling civil disturbances \[[08:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=494)].  
* 💥 Trump is floating the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow military units to raid, detain, and arrest Americans \[[08:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=519)].  
* 🚨 Unmarked federal agents are using fast and loose tactics in cities like Chicago \[[08:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=528)], risking a bloody incident that Trump could use to justify more force \[[09:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=572)].  
* 🛑 The ultimate goal is to hold onto power, either by finding a pretext to invoke martial law and intimidate voters at polling places \[[11:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=664)] or by labeling opposition as terrorists or criminals to discredit them and prevent them from winning elections \[[11:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=679)].  
* 🏛️ Congress must reclaim its power over the use of force, starting with the introduction of the No Troops in Our Streets Act \[[13:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=815)].  
* 📜 Military members must uphold their oath to the Constitution and push back on illegal orders rather than showing loyalty to one man \[[14:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=854)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
 Senator Slotkin's 🚨 speech warns of a deliberate shift toward authoritarianism, focusing heavily on three specific actions: 🚢 Caribbean strikes, 📝 the domestic terrorism executive order, and 💂 military deployment in cities.  
  
The 🚢 Caribbean strikes represent a major point of contrast between the administration's stated goals and legal scrutiny. While Senator Slotkin focuses on the administration's refusal to provide Congress with the legal memo and names of targeted groups \[[04:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=244)], outside legal experts corroborate this lack of transparency and question the lawfulness of the action. Articles from Just Security and the Center for American Progress state that the strikes, which killed dozens, are extrajudicial killings and that the claim of being in an armed conflict with cartels is a dangerous and illegal abuse of wartime power. Furthermore, some sources, including Wikipedia, note that analysts view the strikes as potentially aimed at 🇻🇪 regime change in Venezuela, which is a broader geopolitical concern not fully explored in the speech.  
  
The 📝 domestic terrorism executive order, National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM-7), is a chilling development that validates the Senator's concerns. Reporting from Morgan Lewis and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) confirms the broad scope of the order, which targets organizations promoting anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, anti-Christianity and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, or morality. This expansive language, which the ACLU calls a deliberate attempt to sow fear and intimidate and silence opposition, supports the Senator's fear that the list will be used to target Americans for disagreeing with the president's agenda \[[06:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=415)].  
  
For a 🧠 better understanding, it would be beneficial to explore:  
* 📜 The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act and its exceptions, particularly the 1807 Insurrection Act, which President Trump has floated invoking \[[08:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=519)].  
* 🌐 The 🇻🇪 geopolitical context for the Caribbean strikes, including their potential impact on US-Venezuelan relations and regional stability, as suggested by WAMC and the Center for American Progress.  
* ⚖️ The legal battle surrounding the deployment of the National Guard in American cities, specifically the Supreme Court's involvement in blocking the deployment in Chicago, as mentioned in a report by Michigan Public.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### ❓ Q: What is the main concern regarding the Trump administration's use of force in the Caribbean?  
✅ A: The main concern is that the 🇺🇸 administration is conducting lethal airstrikes against boats suspected of drug trafficking without providing 📝 Congress or the American public with the names of the targeted organizations or the Justice Department's legal justification \[[04:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=244)]. Legal experts have publicly questioned the legality of these attacks under both domestic and 🌍 international law, viewing them as unprecedented and potentially extrajudicial killings (Just Security).  
  
### ❓ Q: What could be the practical effect of the executive order creating a list of domestic terrorist organizations?  
✅ A: The 📝 executive order directs the Justice Department to compile a list of groups defined by broad ideological criteria, including anti-capitalism and anti-Christianity (Morgan Lewis). The practical effect is that 🧍 people on this secret list could face federal surveillance, wiretaps, searches, or arrest for non-violent political disagreement, effectively turning the federal government's intelligence community against American citizens \[[06:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=415)].  
  
### ❓ Q: What is the No Troops in Our Streets Act and what is its purpose?  
✅ A: The No Troops in Our Streets Act is a 🏛️ proposed bill intended to reclaim Congress's power over the use of force in American cities \[[13:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=815)]. Its purpose is to give Congress the explicit authority to 🛑 immediately end a military deployment in an American city, thereby preventing the president from unilaterally using the military or National Guard as a political force against the American people \[[13:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUO0Plcpbo&t=839)].
