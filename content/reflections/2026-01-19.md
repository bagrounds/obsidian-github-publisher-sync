## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
🌵 The desert wind, as ever, bit at the Little Prince's cloak. 🥀 He sat on his tiny planet, a rose wilting beside him, and watched the stars. ⚔️ "They're all just… dust," a gruff voice grumbled from behind him. 🩸 It was Logen Ninefingers, inexplicably transported from his blood-soaked world. ❄️ "No purpose, no meaning. Just endless, cold dust." ✨ The Little Prince, unfazed, picked a single, resilient star from the sky. 🤲 "Perhaps," he said, holding it out. 🌟 "But even dust can shine, if you hold it gently." 🪓 Logen just grunted, probably thinking about splitting skulls, but even he couldn't deny the warmth from the tiny, glowing speck.
