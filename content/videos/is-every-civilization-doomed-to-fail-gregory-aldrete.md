### The Theory of Anacyclosis  
- **Concept Introduction**:    
  - Polybius developed the theory of Anacyclosis, describing a cyclical pattern in governmental forms.    
- **Stages of Government**:    
  1. **Monarchy** â€“ Rule by one, often emerging from a need for order.    
  2. **Kingship to Tyranny** â€“ Monarchy can devolve into tyranny when power is abused.    
  3. **Aristocracy** â€“ A group of elites take control to check the tyrant.    
  4. **Oligarchy** â€“ Aristocracy can decline into oligarchy, serving the interests of a few.    
  5. **Democracy** â€“ The masses overthrow the oligarchs, establishing rule by the people.    
  6. **Ochlocracy (Mob Rule)** â€“ Democracy can degenerate into mob rule, leading to chaos.    
  7. **Return to Monarchy** â€“ In the chaos, a single ruler emerges, restarting the cycle.
