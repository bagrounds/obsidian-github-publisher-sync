🧠 A comprehensive philosophical work that argues for the cognitive and evaluative nature of emotions, contending that they are not irrational forces but intelligent appraisals deeply connected to our values and well-being. Nussbaum's neo-Stoic theory posits that emotions are judgments about things and persons outside our control that hold great importance for our flourishing, highlighting our inherent neediness and vulnerability. The book traverses philosophy, psychology, anthropology, music, and literature to explore emotions like compassion and love, asserting that an adequate ethical theory requires a thorough understanding of emotions, their cultural origins, and their development from infancy.
