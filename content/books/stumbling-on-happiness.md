# Stumbling on Happiness  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### Stumbling on Happiness Summary 🧠  
**TL;DR:** We're terrible at predicting what will make us happy because our brains use flawed simulations of the future, leading to choices that often don't deliver the expected joy.  
  
### A New Perspective on Happiness 🤔  
This book offers a surprising perspective by arguing that our intuitive understanding of happiness is fundamentally flawed. It challenges the common belief that we can accurately predict our future emotional states. Instead, it reveals the systematic errors our brains make when imagining the future, highlighting the gap between what we expect will make us happy and what actually does. This shift in perspective encourages readers to question their assumptions about happiness and to rely less on their predictive abilities, promoting a more mindful and present-focused approach to life.
