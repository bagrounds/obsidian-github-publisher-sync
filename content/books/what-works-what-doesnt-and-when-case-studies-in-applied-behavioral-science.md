## 🌍 In the Unpredictable World of Nudges, What Works, What Doesn't, and When?  
  
**📖 A deep dive into the real-world application of behavioral science, this book report on *What Works, What Doesn't, and When: Case Studies in Applied Behavioral Science*, edited by Dilip Soman, explores its key insights and offers a plethora of related reading for the curious mind.**  
  
🧐 This collection of seventeen case studies offers a candid, behind-the-scenes look at the messy reality of applying behavioral science to real-world problems. 🧪 Moving beyond the theoretical, the book provides a "warts and all" approach, sharing both the triumphs and the informative failures of behavioral interventions in the wild.  
  
### 💡 The Core of the Matter: From Theory to Practice  
  
🛣️ The central theme of *What Works, What Doesn't, and When* is the journey of behavioral science from the controlled environment of the laboratory to the complex and often unpredictable real world. 🔬 The book showcases the entire process, from the initial spark of an idea and the design of tailored interventions to the critical analysis of the results. 🎯 The case studies span a diverse range of domains, including:  
  
* 💰 **Financial Decisions:** Examining interventions aimed at improving savings habits and financial literacy.  
* ❤️‍🩹 **Health and Well-being:** Exploring strategies to increase medication adherence and promote healthier lifestyles.  
* 🌳 **Environmental Conservation:** Detailing efforts to encourage energy conservation and other pro-environmental behaviors.  
* 🤝 **Social Issues:** Tackling challenges such as reducing fare evasion and increasing diversity and inclusion.  
  
🔑 A key takeaway is the crucial role of context. 🧩 An intervention that proves successful in one scenario may fall flat in another, highlighting the necessity of tailoring and rigorous testing. ✍️ The book champions a reflective approach, emphasizing the valuable lessons that can be gleaned from unexpected outcomes and outright failures.  
  
### 🎯 For Whom the Nudge Tolls: The Intended Audience  
  
📚 This book is an invaluable resource for a wide audience. 👨‍🏫 Academics will appreciate the detailed case studies and the transparent discussion of research methodologies. 👩‍💼 Practitioners and policymakers will find prescriptive advice on implementing their own behavior change projects and the pitfalls to avoid. 🤔 Anyone interested in the practical application of behavioral science will find this compendium both informative and refreshingly honest.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
  
### ➕ Similar Sips: More on Applied Behavioral Science  
  
* 📖 ***Nudge: The Final Edition*** by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein: The book that arguably launched the modern popularization of behavioral science in public policy. 🏛️ It provides the foundational concepts of "nudging" and choice architecture that are put to the test in *What Works, What Doesn't, and When*.  
* **[🤔🐇🐢 Thinking, Fast and Slow](./thinking-fast-and-slow.md)** by Daniel Kahneman: A deep dive into the two systems of thinking that govern our minds, written by a Nobel laureate. 🤯 This book provides the psychological underpinning for many of the interventions discussed in the case studies.  
* 📊 ***Behavioral Insights*** by Michael Hallsworth and Elspeth Kirkman: A solid guide on the practical application of behavioral science to public policy, offering a structured approach to designing and implementing interventions.  
* **[🔄🧠💪 The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business](./the-power-of-habit.md)** by Charles Duhigg: While focused on individual and organizational habits, this book's exploration of habit loops and keystone habits provides a valuable framework for understanding and changing behavior on a larger scale.  
  
### ➖ Contrasting Views: A Critical Lens on Nudging  
  
* 🧐 ***Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart*** by Gerd Gigerenzer, Peter Todd, and the ABC Research Group: This book challenges the idea that human decision-making is inherently flawed, arguing that simple heuristics are often surprisingly effective in the real world.  
* **[📊⛓️👑 📏 The Tyranny of Metrics](./the-tyranny-of-metrics.md)** by Jerry Z. Muller: A critical examination of the modern obsession with quantifiable performance indicators. 📈 This book offers a thought-provoking counterpoint to the data-driven approach of many behavioral interventions.  
* 🗽 ***Escaping Paternalism: Rationality, Behavioral Economics, and Public Policy*** by Mario J. Rizzo and Glen Whitman: This book presents a strong critique of the paternalistic arguments often used to justify nudging, raising important questions about individual autonomy and freedom of choice.  
* 🤔 ***Why Nudge?: The Politics of Libertarian Paternalism*** by Cass R. Sunstein: In this book, one of the co-authors of *Nudge* addresses the ethical and political criticisms leveled against the concept, making a case for its use as a tool for improving welfare.  
  
### 🎨 Creatively Related Reads: Expanding the Framework  
  
* 🗑️ ***Subtract: The Untapped Science of Less*** by Leidy Klotz: This book offers a fresh perspective on problem-solving, arguing that we often overlook the power of removal. ➖ This concept of "subtraction" can be a powerful, yet often neglected, tool in designing interventions.  
* 🏗️ ***How Big Things Get Done*** by Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner: An exploration of why so many large-scale projects fail and what can be done to make them succeed. 🏢 This provides a macro-level parallel to the micro-level interventions discussed in *What Works, What Doesn't, and When*.  
* 🧭 ***The Scout Mindset: Why Some People See Things Clearly and Others Don't*** by Julia Galef: This book champions the importance of intellectual curiosity, and the ability to see things as they are, not as we wish them to be. 👀 This "scout mindset" is essential for the honest and reflective approach to behavioral science advocated for in *What Works, What Doesn't, and When*.  
* 😈 ***The Art of Insubordination: How to Dissent and Defy Effectively*** by Todd Kashdan: While seemingly counterintuitive, this book's exploration of principled rebellion and constructive dissent offers valuable insights into how to challenge the status quo and drive meaningful change, a theme that resonates with the innovative spirit of applied behavioral science.
