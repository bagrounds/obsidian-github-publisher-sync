### 📜 Summary  
  
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 The story follows a little chameleon who is sad because, unlike other animals that have a distinct color of their own (🐘 elephants are gray, 🐷 pigs are pink, 🦜 parrots are green), he changes color to match whatever he is on. 😔 He longs for a permanent color. 🌿 He attempts to solve this by staying on a green leaf, hoping to remain green forever. 🍂 However, as the seasons change, the leaf turns yellow and then red, causing the chameleon to change color too. 😥 Feeling lonely and different, he meets another chameleon who also changes color. 🤝 They decide to stay together, realizing that while their colors will continue to change with their surroundings, they will always be the same when they are together. 😊 This companionship brings the little chameleon happiness.
