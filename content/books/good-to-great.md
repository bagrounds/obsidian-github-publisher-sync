# Good To Great  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### Good to Great Summary 🚀  
**TL;DR:** Sustained greatness in companies comes from disciplined people, disciplined thought, and disciplined action, not from charismatic leaders or trendy strategies.  
  
### New or Surprising Perspective 💡  
"Good to Great" challenges conventional wisdom by demonstrating that greatness isn't about flashy personalities or quick fixes. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of a methodical, almost stoic approach to building a lasting enterprise. It surprises readers by showing that many "great" companies were led by seemingly ordinary, unassuming individuals who focused on building a culture of discipline and rigor. This perspective shifts the focus from external charisma to internal character, making greatness seem more attainable for anyone willing to put in the hard work. 🤯
