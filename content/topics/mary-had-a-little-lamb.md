## 🎶 Lyrics  
🐑 Mary had a little lamb,  
❄️ Its fleece was white as snow;  
👣 And everywhere that Mary went,  
🐑 The lamb was sure to go.  
  
🏫 It followed her to school one day,  
🚫 That was against the rule;  
😂 It made the children laugh and play,  
🐑 To see a lamb at school.  
  
🚪 And so the teacher turned it out,  
🌳 But still it lingered near;  
⏳ And waited patiently about,  
👧 Till Mary did appear.  
  
🙋‍♂️ Why does the lamb love Mary so?  
🗣️ The eager children cry;  
❤️ Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,  
👨‍🏫 The teacher did reply.
