# Cybernetics  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
*Cybernetics* (1948) by Norbert Wiener explores the study of systems, feedback, control, and communication in both living organisms and machines. It emphasizes how systems regulate themselves through feedback loops and highlights the role of information in controlling behavior across biological, mechanical, and social systems. The book lays the foundation for fields like systems theory, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

   This book expands on the concepts Wiener introduced, particularly the application of cybernetics to learning systems and human behavior.  
  
2. **Tangentially related**:    
   *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* by Thomas S. Kuhn    
   While not about cybernetics directly, Kuhn's exploration of paradigm shifts in science resonates with Wiener's ideas on systems thinking and change.  
  
3. **Diametrically opposed**:    
   *The Myth of the Machine* by Lewis Mumford    
   Mumford critiques the mechanistic approach to human society, arguing that technological determinism can alienate humanity, opposing the optimistic view of cybernetics.  
  
4. **Fiction book incorporating related ideas**:    
   *The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress* by Robert A. Heinlein    
   This science fiction novel features themes of systems, feedback loops, and self-regulation in the context of a sentient computer and a lunar rebellion, reflecting cybernetic ideas in a fictional setting.
