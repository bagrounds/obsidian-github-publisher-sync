# 👴🚫📈 Why the Trump Administration Is Doubling Down as Momentum Grows Against Them | Explainer  
![Why the Trump Administration Is Doubling Down as Momentum Grows Against Them | Explainer](https://youtu.be/AKSU660ILJc)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
- ⚖️ A court found that many of the administration's 💰 tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, were illegal because the Constitution gives Congress alone the power to put tariffs on products \[[00:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=19)].  
  
- 🇺🇸 The administration is insisting that without these tariffs, America will become a third-world country, even though the economy was doing well before the tariffs were put in place \[[01:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=64)].  
  
- 👮‍♂️ A California judge ruled that the use of Marines and federalized National Guard in Los Angeles was illegal, as it violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the domestic use of the U.S. Army as law enforcement \[[02:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=139)].  
  
- 🤝 Democratic governors, sometimes in collaboration with Republicans, are banding together to take a stand against the administration on various issues, such as the cancellation of funding for clean energy projects \[[04:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=269)].  
  
- 📂 Congress is back in session and there is a discharge petition to force the release of the Epstein files \[[11:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=663)]. The failure to release these files is causing a split in the MAGA movement, as many supporters expected the administration to release them \[[12:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=722)].  
  
- 🩺 The video also touches on the crisis in the CDC, with budget cuts to Medicaid and the slashing of funding for cancer research \[[13:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=793)]. Nine former CDC directors have publicly stated that the administration is "destroying public health" \[[15:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKSU660ILJc&t=956)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
The video presents a critical perspective on the Trump administration's legal and political challenges. ⚖️ It focuses on court rulings and political opposition to highlight issues with the administration's use of power. 🧐 An alternative perspective might argue that the administration's actions were necessary to protect national interests, such as using tariffs to safeguard the economy or deploying the military for domestic security. 🛡️ To better understand the issues, one could explore the legal arguments for and against the use of tariffs and the Posse Comitatus Act. 📚 It would also be useful to research the perspectives of the former CDC directors and the administration's reasoning behind the budget cuts.
