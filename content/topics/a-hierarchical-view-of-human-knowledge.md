# A Hierarchical View of Human Knowledge  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
**Introduction: A Hierarchical View of Human Knowledge** 🧠  
  
Human knowledge can be conceptually organized into a hierarchical structure, where broad, overarching categories branch into increasingly specific subcategories. While this structure is a simplification and acknowledges the interconnectedness of knowledge 🔗, it provides a useful framework for exploration and understanding 🗺️. At the highest level, we propose the following categories as a starting point:  
  
**Top-Level Categories of Human Knowledge:**  
* [Science](./science.md) 🔬  
* [Mathematics](./math.md) 🔢  
* [Engineering](./engineering.md) 🚂  
* [Technology](./technology.md) 💻  
* [Humanities](./humanities.md) 📜  
* [Social Sciences](./social-sciences.md) 👥  
* Arts 🎨  
* Religion 🙏  
* [Philosophy](./philosophy.md) 🤔  
  
**Justification for This Set of Categories:**  
These categories are chosen as the top level because they represent:  
  
1.  **Fundamental Domains of Inquiry:** They encompass the major areas in which humans actively seek and organize knowledge 💡.  
2.  **Established Academic Divisions:** They align with the traditional and widely recognized divisions of academic disciplines found in universities and research institutions globally 🏫. This reflects a long history of organizing knowledge for study and advancement.  
3.  **Comprehensive Scope:** Collectively, they aim to cover the breadth of human intellectual and creative endeavors, from the objective study of the natural world to the subjective exploration of human experience and meaning 🌍.  
4.  **Practical Organizational Utility:** These categories are used in widely used systems of knowledge organization, such as the Library of Congress Classification, showing their practical value in managing and accessing information 📚.  
5.  **Foundational Importance:** They represent areas of study that provide the basis for further specialization. For example, scientific knowledge is foundational to technological development, and philosophical inquiry informs ethical considerations across all domains 🏗️.  
6.  **Recognizable and Understood:** These categories are generally understood by a large portion of the population. This makes them a great starting point, for further exploration 🤝.  
  
this hierarchy is not rigid. Knowledge is fluid and interconnected, and these categories often overlap. However, this framework serves as a valuable starting point for exploring the vast landscape of human knowledge ✨.
