## 🤖 AI Summary  
* A deeper political divide is evident due to a stronger dislike and fear toward opposing sides, viewing them as a "threat to the nation" \[[00:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_Az5nZBBM&t=48)].  
* Three 🤝 principles of moral psychology and societal changes are the cause of this division:  
    * Humans are inherently 🫂 tribal, and modern society has made these conflicts more bitter.  
    * People are not 🧠 persuaded by facts and evidence because reasoning is used to defend group interests rather than to find the truth \[[07:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_Az5nZBBM&t=453)]. The internet and social media have amplified this by allowing people to easily find information that confirms their existing biases \[[08:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_Az5nZBBM&t=487)].  
    * Political discourse has shifted from anger to 🤢 disgust and contempt, which paint the opponent as subhuman and evil \[[11:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_Az5nZBBM&t=717)].  
* Several factors have contributed to this 📈 deepening division: the retirement of the World War II generation known for compromise, the "purification" of the two political parties, and the rise of "negative partisanship" where people vote against the other side \[[14:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_Az5nZBBM&t=895)].  
* 👀 A new type of empathy is suggested that involves understanding people one is "disgusted by" \[[16:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-_Az5nZBBM&t=1010)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
The video's perspective on political polarization through the lens of moral psychology and tribalism provides a compelling framework for understanding the current American political landscape. However, the analysis could be strengthened by exploring the role of economic inequality and the influence of media consolidation, which are also significant drivers of social division.  
  
To gain a more comprehensive understanding, it would be beneficial to explore topics such as:  
* The 🗺️ globalization of political polarization and whether similar patterns exist in other countries.  
* The 📱 role of social media algorithms in creating echo chambers and amplifying partisan content.  
* The historical context of political division in the United States, including past periods of intense partisanship.
