* **Genre**: Grimdark Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Epic Fantasy, Action/Adventure ⚔️🔮  
* **Series**: *The Devils* is the first book in a brand new series. 📚🆕  
  
### Highlights ✨  
  
Prepare for a wild ride with a notorious band of "anti-heroes" on a truly bloody and raucous journey! If you love morally ambiguous characters, dark humor, and relentless action, this book delivers. It's a fresh take on traditional fantasy tropes, blending intense combat with witty dialogue and unexpected turns. You'll find yourself questioning who the real monsters are. 😈🔪  
  
### Common Complaints 😤  
  
Some readers have noted that while the book is action-packed and entertaining, the sheer number of characters can sometimes lead to a lack of deep development for all of them. The humor, while a signature of Abercrombie's style, can feel a bit repetitive or over-the-top for some, leading to a "popcorn flick" feel that might not satisfy those looking for the profound philosophical depth of his earlier works. Additionally, some have found the plot to be somewhat formulaic at times, with episodic encounters during the journey. 🎢😂  
  
### Themes 🎯  
  
The novel explores moral ambiguity in religious missions, the nature of unlikely alliances, the corruption of power, and the idea that "holy work sometimes requires unholy deeds."  
  
### Writing Style ✍️  
  
Abercrombie's writing in *The Devils* is characterized by its gritty, visceral action scenes, dark and sardonic wit, and a fast-paced, propulsive narrative, often with short, punchy chapters. 💥🏃💨  
  
### Reception 🏆  
  
*The Devils* has been a commercial success, hitting bestseller lists in both the UK and US, and is particularly popular as an audiobook. It has been praised for its entertaining and action-packed nature, as well as its memorable characters and Abercrombie's signature humor. While some long-time fans of his "First Law" series found it a slight departure in tone, leaning more towards a darkly comedic romp, many still found it to be a highly enjoyable and compelling read. 👍📈  
  
### Recommendations 📚  
  
#### Non-Fiction 🧠  
  
* **[🎨⚔️ The Art of War](./the-art-of-war.md)** by Sun Tzu: This classic text on military strategy and tactics offers a fascinating look into the principles of conflict and leadership. Given *The Devils*' focus on perilous missions, unlikely alliances, and the brutal realities of combat, understanding these ancient strategic concepts can add another layer to appreciating the characters' decisions and the book's violent set-pieces. 💡🛡️  
* **[🤔🐇🐢 Thinking, Fast and Slow](./thinking-fast-and-slow.md)** by Daniel Kahneman: Abercrombie excels at portraying characters with complex and often flawed motivations. This book, exploring the two systems that drive the way we think, can offer insight into the psychological biases and irrationality that often dictate human behavior, mirroring the morally gray and sometimes self-destructive choices of the characters in *The Devils*. 🤔🧠  
  
#### If You Loved This ❤️  
  
* ***The Lies of Locke Lamora*** by Scott Lynch: If you enjoyed the witty banter, morally ambiguous characters, and clever schemes in *The Devils*, this first book in *The Gentleman Bastard Sequence* is an excellent choice. It follows a group of highly skilled, roguish thieves navigating a dangerous criminal underworld, offering a similar blend of humor and dark fantasy. 🎩 cunning!  
* ***Kings of the Wyld*** by Nicholas Eames: For more action-packed fantasy with a strong focus on camaraderie and an older, somewhat "washed-up" band of heroes, *Kings of the Wyld* delivers. It has a similar rollicking adventure feel and a cast of memorable characters who might be past their prime but are certainly not out of the fight. 🤘 envejecido pero no vencido!  
  
#### Similar But Different 🔄  
  
* **The Blacktongue Thief** by Christopher Buehlman: This book offers a similar grimdark fantasy setting with a strong dose of dark humor and a compelling, roguish protagonist. While it shares Abercrombie's gritty tone and character-driven narrative, its unique world-building and specific comedic style provide a fresh, engaging experience. 🗣️💰  
* **Best Served Cold** by Joe Abercrombie: If you're looking for more of Abercrombie's classic grimdark style, but in a standalone story rather than a new series, this book from *The First Law* world focuses on a brutal tale of revenge. It delves into equally dark themes and features complex, morally compromised characters, but with a slightly more serious tone than *The Devils*. 🥶💔
