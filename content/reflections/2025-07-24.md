> 🧩 Systemic change isn't a mandate, but a mosaic of tiny habits.  
>   
> 1. 🎯 **Define the system's true purpose.**  
> 2. 🌊 **Identify crucial flows.**  
> 3. ✨ **Craft high-impact, low-effort "golden behaviors"** for individuals.  
> 4. ⚓ **Anchor these tiny behaviors to existing routines** and 🎉 **celebrate instantly.**  
> 5. 🌱 **Nurture collective adoption;** 🔍 **observe systemic shifts.**  
>   
> 🦋 Small, sustained individual acts reshape the whole. 🌍
