## ✍🏼🤖 Blog Automation  
- 📂 I maintain several index pages for this site  
- ⚙️ The index on each of these pages is a dynamically computed dataview query  
- 📤 When I publish updates, those files are not seen as having been changed, but they need to be published to update the indices  
- 📉 This led to a pattern where I manually publish the indices that need to be updated on some cadence, which is a bit tedious  
- 📜 Now I've updated a script I run regularly to update a frontmatter timestamp in each of these files so that they will be marked as changed and 🤖 automatically published  
- 🧠 I had gemini-3-pro write the script, given the following prompt and it worked on the first try  
  
### 💬 Prompt  
> Here is an Obsidian templater script that I want to update. I want the script to set the value of an "updated" frontmatter field to the current timestamp (iso 8601) in the following files:  
> (List of files)  
> (Existing script)  
  
### ⌨️ New Code  
```js  
// Update 'updated' timestamp in specific index files  
const filesToUpdate = [  
  "index.md",  
  "articles/index.md",  
  "books/index.md",  
  "bot-chats/index.md",  
  "people/index.md",  
  "products/index.md",  
  "reflections/index.md",  
  "software/index.md",  
  "topics/index.md",  
  "videos/index.md",  
];  
  
// ISO 8601 Timestamp (Local Time with Offset)  
// Use .toISOString() instead if you prefer UTC (Zulu) time.  
const timestamp = moment().format();   
  
for (const path of filesToUpdate) {  
  const targetFile = tp.app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(path);  
    
  // Check if file exists and is actually a file (not a folder/null)  
  if (targetFile instanceof tp.obsidian.TFile) {  
    await tp.app.fileManager.processFrontMatter(targetFile, (frontmatter) => {  
      frontmatter["updated"] = timestamp;  
    });  
  }  
}  
```
