## 🤖 AI Summary  
📚 This video introduces a 🖐️ five-step method for creating a "reading map," a 🗺️ self-made curriculum designed to help individuals learn anything they want through books in a structured way \[[01:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=75)\].  
  
Here's a breakdown of the 🖐️ five steps:  
  
* **Step 1: 🎯 Define Your Learning Goal** \[[02:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=143)\]  
    * Identify 🧠 what you want to learn and how deeply you want to learn it \[[02:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=166)\].  
    * Topics can be 🌳 broad (e.g., sociology) or 🌿 niche (e.g., ancient medical practices) \[[03:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=181)\].  
    * You can also define your goal by 📖 reading every book by a certain author or a specific type of book from a particular era \[[03:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=197)\].  
    * If you don't know what to learn, 🌍 explore various subjects through educational YouTube channels like Crash Course \[[03:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=225)\].  
    * If you have too many interests, 🧠 brainstorm them and prioritize the top two to three that align with your current goals or desired identity \[[04:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=273)\].  
    * Decide on the 📏 depth of learning: 5-10 books for foundational knowledge, 10-30 for a mini-expert level, and 30-50 for mastery \[[05:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=338)\].  
    * Break down your main topic into 🧩 subtopics to build depth in key areas \[[06:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=367)\].  
  
* **Step 2: 📚 Gather Potential Books** \[[06:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=396)\]  
    * This is a " messy phase" where you 📥 collect any books that might be interesting and help you achieve your goal \[[06:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=401)\].  
    * Consider 📚 different types of books:  
        * **📖 Introductory books:** Short, accessible overviews (e.g., Oxford Very Short Introductions) \[[07:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=433)\].  
        * **📝 Secondary sources:** Books where scholars explain or build on original ideas \[[07:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=443)\].  
        * **📜 Primary sources:** Original works by the thinkers who developed specific ideas (e.g., Plato's Republic) \[[07:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=468)\].  
        * **🏛️ Classics:** Works that have stood the test of time and shaped fields \[[08:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=496)\].  
        * **💡 Lighter reads:** Memoirs, narrative non-fiction, or even fiction that relates to your topic, offering emotional depth and real-world context \[[08:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=513)\].  
    * Find books using 🌐 resources like Google, Wikipedia bibliographies, suggested reading sections in introductory books, MIT and Yale Open Courseware syllabuses, AI chat recommendations, Reddit, Quora, and YouTube \[[09:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=567)\].  
  
* **Step 3: ✅ Vet and Organize Your Books** \[[10:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=646)\]  
    * **🔍 Screen the books:** Ask questions like: Is it beginner-friendly? Is it outdated or biased? Is the author reputable? Does it cover what you think it does? Is it engaging? \[[11:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=673)\] Use Goodreads to read summaries and reviews \[[11:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=693)\].  
    * **🗂️ Organize your list:**  
        * By 🪜 difficulty: Start with easier, broader books and move to more complex ones \[[12:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=724)\].  
        * 🗓️ Chronologically: Effective for subjects like history, philosophy, or literature \[[12:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=731)\].  
  
* **Step 4: 🛍️ Acquire and Read Your Books** \[[12:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=744)\]  
    * Find books 💰 cheaply or for free through:  
        * 🏛️ Local libraries and the Libby app for ebooks and audiobooks \[[12:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=765)\].  
        * 🛒 Thrift stores and used bookstores \[[12:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=778)\].  
        * 💻 Buying used books online (Amazon's used section, Thrift Books, Better World Books) \[[13:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=791)\].  
        * 📄 Searching for PDF versions online \[[13:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=806)\].  
    * Don't feel 😔 guilty about abandoning a book if it's boring, too dense, or not resonating with you; your curiosity should guide you \[[13:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=836)\].  
  
* **Step 5: ✍️ Interact with Your Books** \[[14:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=875)\]  
    * Don't just 🧘 passively read; reflect on the main ideas and relate the material to your life \[[15:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=906)\].  
    * 📝 Write a book review for every book you read \[[15:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=920)\]. Include:  
        * ✍️ A short summary in your own words \[[15:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=933)\].  
        * 🧠 What you learned or what stood out \[[15:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=935)\].  
        * ❓ What confused you or questions you still have \[[15:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=937)\].  
        * 🔗 How it connects to other things you've read \[[15:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=940)\].  
        * 👍 What you agreed or disagreed with \[[15:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=943)\].  
        * 👍 Whether you'd recommend it and to whom \[[15:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=944)\].  
    * Writing reviews 🧠 strengthens memory, 🔍 reveals knowledge gaps, 🤔 helps form your own opinions, and 🗣️ makes you a better thinker and communicator \[[15:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=954)\]. This practice transforms your reading map into an 🗺️ active learning system \[[16:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U23HVqrY_fI&t=1006)\].
