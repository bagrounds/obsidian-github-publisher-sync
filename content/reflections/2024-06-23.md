## 🗓️ Scheduling Interviews  
I have a pretty good 👨‍💼 interview preparation and practice 🏋️ routine in place.  
But I don't currently have any 🤷 interviews scheduled.   
How should I _get_ more interviews? 🤔  
1. 🧑‍💼 **Recruiters contact me** via, e.g. LinkedIn 🔗  
    1.  👍 This makes my job very easy  
    2. ☝️ For my prior interview, this is what happened  
    3. 😟 But there are a few issues with this  
        1. 🚫 Lack of control. If nobody reaches out, and my queue is empty 🪹, I'm out of luck. 🍀  
2. 📝 Apply to job postings  
    1. ⏳ It's been a while since I've directly applied.  
    2. 🧐 Do they actually respond to applications?  
    3. 🎯 It does seem like a very direct way to proactively seek a job.  
3. 🗣️ Query my network   
    1.  🤝 Friends and past colleagues could be hiring, know someone who is, or even just put in a referral at their company.  
    2.  🌐 I believe networking is where most jobs come from ... Or I've read things to this effect. 📚
