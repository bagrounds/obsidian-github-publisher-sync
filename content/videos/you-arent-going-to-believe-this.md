## 🤖 AI Summary  
Senator Adam Schiff discusses several critical issues regarding the changes and priorities within the Justice Department under Donald Trump's administration:  
  
* 🧑‍⚖️ **Appointment of Jared Weiss to the Justice Department** \[[01:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaTV7rd1LQ&t=96)\]: 📢 Jared Weiss, a January 6th rioter who was heard yelling "Kill him, kill him, kill him" at law enforcement officers outside the Capitol, was appointed to a high-ranking position in Donald Trump's Justice Department within the "weaponization working group" headed by Ed Martin.  
* 👨‍⚖️ **Pardon of Jared Weiss** \[[03:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaTV7rd1LQ&t=183)\]: 📜 Donald Trump pardoned Jared Weiss before his case, which included two felony and four misdemeanor counts, could go to conviction after being tried and sent to the jury.  
* 🕵️ **Purge and Morale Issues at the FBI** \[[03:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaTV7rd1LQ&t=223)\]: 🧹 There was a purge within the FBI, where top managers involved in January 6th prosecutions were fired. 😔 Hundreds of FBI agents are taking early retirement due to morale problems.  
* 💸 **Diversion of Resources from Serious Criminal Investigations** \[[04:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaTV7rd1LQ&t=283)\]:  
    * 🚨 Resources are being pulled from serious criminal investigations to focus on the president's political priorities, such as going after perceived enemies and dismissing valid corruption cases. 😡  
    * 📉 There's a deemphasis on white-collar and corporate crime prosecutions.  
    * 🛂 Agents are being diverted to indiscriminate immigration raids, often targeting individuals with no criminal record other than being undocumented, pulling them away from cases like child trafficking, drug cases, and border security. 💔  
* 🛂 **Appointment of Thomas Fugate to Homeland Security** \[[07:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoaTV7rd1LQ&t=466)\]: 👦 Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old former Trump campaign advance person with no national security experience, was appointed to head the unit at the Department of Homeland Security responsible for combating terrorism. 💣 His qualification is described as "utter sycophancy" and "total obedience to the person of Donald Trump." 🤡
