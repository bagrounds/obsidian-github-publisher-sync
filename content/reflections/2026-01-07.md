## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
🏙️ The alley was a narrow throat of 🏚️ rot and shadows. 🛡️ Elara stood her ground, her 💓 heart drumming a frantic, ugly rhythm against her ribs.  
  
👦 Behind her, the boy huddled in the 🌑 dark - a scrap of human grit in the ⚙️ state’s gears. The 🕴️ agents moved in with the bored grace of 🔪 butchers. One drew a long, 🗡️ grey blade, the steel whispering as it cleared the scabbard. He swung in a casual arc, aiming for the boy’s neck.  
  
🤺 Elara moved. Her ⚔️ sword met his with a jarring, bone-deep 💥 **clang**.  
  
🦷 The vibration rattled her teeth, but she 🧱 didn't give an inch. She leaned into the bind, shoved the man’s weight back, and found the 🔓 opening. She saw the 👁️ fear flicker in his stone-flat eyes. She had him. One 🕒 quick turn of the wrist and she’d be clear, the boy safe, the day won. She felt a ⚡ jolt of heat in her marrow - a wild, soaring 🏆 triumph.  
  
❄️ Then the cold 🗡️ bit through her back.  
  
🗡️ It wasn't a roar or a flash; just a foot of sharp, indifferent steel 🩸 punching through her ribs from behind. A 👤 second agent had stepped in, silent as a 🌑 shadow.  
  
🛐 Elara’s knees hit the 🤮 filth. The 🌀 world tilted, her victory turning to a sudden, 🧊 biting ice. She watched the 👢 boy’s boots vanish into the gloom - a frantic, fading beat of 🏃 footsteps.  
  
🏠 *I should've stayed home,* she 💭 thought, her 🌫️ vision narrowing to a grey pinprick. Her 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 children’s faces flickered in the dark, and a sudden, 💔 bitter pang twisted what was left of her heart.
