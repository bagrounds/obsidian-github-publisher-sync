# [🤖🧱🏗️🧠 An Approach to Building with AI](https://github.com/ajelinek/vibe-rules)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* ⚙️ The process begins with an initial idea and research phase 📝 using Google's Gemini models to create a project summary and perform market analysis.  
* ✍️ A foundational document serves as a source of truth for the project.  
* 🏢 Structured design documents are created by assigning a specific persona to the AI, such as Senior Product Manager or Lead System Architect, to generate a comprehensive project skeleton.  
* 🔄 An iterative development loop is used to take a single feature and create a detailed design with a series of prompts.  
* 📝 The detailed design includes high-level architecture, test scenarios in Gherkin, and implementation details with pseudocode.  
* 💻 For the coding phase, the process switches to Anthropic's Claude models.  
* 🧑‍💻 The human remains in complete control of the design and architecture throughout the workflow.  
* 📈 The process produces exceptional documentation and ensures comprehensive test coverage.  
* 🐢 The workflow may not be the fastest, but it leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.  
* 🤔 Human mental energy is redirected from syntax to strategy.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
The Vibe-Rules approach ⚖️ is a meticulous framework that prioritizes human oversight and systematic design, contrasting sharply with a less structured, "prompt-and-go" development style. While it promises high-quality, well-documented code, it may introduce a significant overhead that could challenge a rapid-prototyping or agile environment. 🚀 For a better understanding, it would be useful to explore:  
* 🧮 The scalability of this method for larger teams and more complex projects.  
* 🧑‍🏫 The learning curve for developers adopting this workflow.  
* 🛠️ How this process integrates with existing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.  
* ⏱️ A direct comparison of development velocity with a more traditional or less-structured AI-assisted method.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
* [🧼💾 Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](../books/clean-code.md) by Robert C. Martin: This book 📖 is similar in its emphasis on writing maintainable, readable, and well-structured code, which is a key outcome of the Vibe-Rules method.  
* [🦄👤🗓️ The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering](../books/the-mythical-man-month.md) by Frederick Brooks Jr.: This classic explores the challenges of software project management, offering a contrasting perspective on why adding more people to a late project often makes it later. ⏱️ It provides context for the strategic, human-centric focus of Vibe-Rules.  
* [💺🚪💡🤔 The Design of Everyday Things](../books/the-design-of-everyday-things.md) by Don Norman: This creatively related book 🤔 discusses the principles of good design in products, providing a broader understanding of the thoughtful, user-centric approach that Vibe-Rules applies to software architecture.  
* [🗑️✨ Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](../books/refactoring-improving-the-design-of-existing-code.md) by Martin Fowler: This book ✍️ offers practical advice on how to improve the structure of existing code, a skill that would complement the Vibe-Rules process of creating clean code from the start.  
* Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices by Robert C. Martin: A contrasting view on software development methodologies, 🏃 this book explores a more flexible and iterative approach that could be compared with the structured Vibe-Rules framework.
