## 👀🤔 Query-Dependent Google Search Results Title Rendering  
A lot of page titles on my site include emojis.  
Depending on the search query, Google might render the title with our without the emojis.  
Examples:  
  
| Query                                   | Rendered Title                                               |

## 🕸️🪵 Blog 💡 Ideas  
Yesterday was this blog's [🥳 One 🕯️](./2025-04-19.md) year anniversary.  
What might the next year bring?  
  
### 🎯 Goal: 📉 Reduce Cost  
Reducing the time and effort required to produce content  
  
#### 🧠⛈️ Brain Storm  
- 🤖🕷️ A content bot that traverses AI generated book reports and generates additional book reports for the recommended books  
  
### 🎯 Goal: 📈 Increase Value  
Increasing the value of content  
  
#### 🧠⛈️ Brain Storm  
- AI generated book synthesis reports  
    - examples  
        - Identify the best books on the proliferation of ideas, motivation, social organization, democracy, and tyranny. Generate a report on how to fuel a movement to fight tyranny, strengthen, and restore democracy.  
        - Identify the best books on systems thinking and parenting. Generate a report on a systems thinking approach to parenting.  
- Feedback  
    - Step 1: evaluate content  
    - Step 2: increase value  
    - Without feedback, it's hard to know how valuable content is in the first place.  
    - examples  
        - fix comments (sometimes I have to reload the page for the comments box to show up - I bet this would be resolved by using the quartz native comments)  
        - encourage more comments  
            - by asking questions of the reader and explicitly encouraging comments  
            - by posting more to social media  
        - instrument with analytics  
            - understanding site usage patterns can help understand what visitors consider valuable
