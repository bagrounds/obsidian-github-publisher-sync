#### Technical Deep Dive 💻  
  
Vensim utilizes a stock and flow paradigm to represent dynamic systems. Stocks are accumulations (e.g., population, inventory), and flows are the rates of change of stocks (e.g., birth rate, production rate). The software solves systems of differential equations numerically to simulate the behavior of these stocks and flows over time. Key features include:  
  
  * **Graphical Function Editor:** Allows users to define non-linear relationships between variables. 📈📉  
  * **SyntheSim:** Provides immediate feedback on model behavior as parameters are changed. 🔄  
  * **Optimization:** Finds optimal parameter values to achieve desired system outcomes. 🎯  
  * **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Assesses model uncertainty by running simulations with randomly varied parameters. 🎲  
  * **DLL Functionality:** enables external code integrations. 🔗
