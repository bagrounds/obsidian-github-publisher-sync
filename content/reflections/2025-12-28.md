## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
🌑 In the year 2077, the Consolidated Sovereignty of America unveiled its latest solution to the burgeoning population crisis and resource scarcity: The Great Purge. 🤖 Overseen by the newly formed Department of Expedited Relocation, citizens deemed non-essential or resource-draining were swiftly identified and processed. 📢 The slogan, Deport Everyone Faster with Confidence, plastered across every digital billboard and re-education camp, became a chilling anthem.  
  
⛓️ Unit 734, a former history professor named Alistair Finch, watched the endless lines shuffle towards the transport gates. 📉 His crime? ⏳ Being over sixty and having a low productivity index. 📻 He remembered the old world, the one with actual borders and due process, now a distant, forgotten dream. 🛸 The air crackled with static from the omnipresent drones, their searchlights sweeping across the desolate landscape of what was once a bustling city square. ❄️ The confidence of the slogan was absolute, cold, and final. 📸 He clutched a tattered photograph of his granddaughter, wondering if she, a child of the new era, would ever know what humanity had lost. 🚪 The gate hissed open, a one-way ticket to the unknown territories beyond the great wall.
