# How to hack your brain to crave doing hard things.  
⛽ Dopamine is fuel for motivation.  
🔥 We have 2 furnaces for burning motivation.  
☯️ The furnace of waste and the furnace of purpose.  
🗑️ When we act to feel good with no long term benefit, we burn our dopamine in the furnace of waste.  
🏔️ When we act toward future benefit, we burn our fuel in the furnace of purpose.  
  
## 5 steps manage dopamine  
1. 👀 **Awareness**. Account for our 2 furnaces.  
2. ✂️ **Elimination**. Systematically rid your life of shallow pleasures that get in the way of your long term purpose.  
3. ⏳ **Timing**. Dopamine is highest in the morning. Spend dopamine on hard, intentional activity before the frivolous. Work on the most important thing for at least 5 minutes every morning.  
4. 🏆 **Rewards**. Still have fun. But be measured. Fun after (or during) hard work is more sustainable than the opposite. A little fun here and there avoids dilution.  
5. 😌 **Recovery**. Don't burn out. Rest a little at the end of each day and a little more at the end of each week.
