The order we eat food in makes a difference for health and energy levels.  
Eat veggies first, then proteins and fats, and carbs last.  
Fiber in the veggies acts like a filter to helps slow the delivery of glucose (sugar) into our blood stream and reduces the spike in blood sugar.  
This helps keep energy levels more even throughout the day, reduces cravings, and keeps our bodies' energy systems healthier.  
It also reduces likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes.
