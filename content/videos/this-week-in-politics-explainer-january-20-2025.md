### 🏆 Heather Cox Richardson’s Global Order Strategy: The Cheat Sheet  
  
#### 🌍 The Collapse of the Rules-Based International Order  
  
* 📉 **Post-WWII Framework**: Stability founded on 1941 Atlantic Charter.  
* 🚫 **Non-Aggression**: Prohibition of invading neighbors for resources.  
* ⚖️ **Conflict Resolution**: Established rules to settle differences diplomatically.  
* 📈 **Economic Growth**: Raising standards of living to prevent the rise of dictators.  
* 🌊 **Open Commons**: Freedom of the seas and low tariff walls.  
* 🛡️ **NATO & Article 5**: 1949 defensive alliance ensuring mutual protection. \[[11:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=667)]  
* 🇺🇸 **US Benefit**: America gained global leadership and economic stability.  
* 🌏 **Poverty Reduction**: Facilitated lifting over 1 billion people out of poverty.  
* 🧨 **The Current Threat**: Presidential dismantling of 80 years of diplomacy. \[[15:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=957)]  
* 🇬🇱 **Greenland Obsession**: Threatening Denmark/NATO allies over personal grievances.  
* 📉 **Global Trust**: Allies diversifying away from US financial and security reliance.  
  
#### ⚙️ The Variable Geometry Alternative  
  
* 📐 **Concept**: A flexible, ad hoc model for international cooperation. \[[39:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=2398)]  
* 🤝 **Issue-Specific Alliances**: Countries unite on specific interests (e.g., fishing, trade, crime) rather than rigid ideological blocs.  
* ✂️ **Ad Hoc Committees**: Shifting tables of partnership based on immediate needs.  
* 🇨🇦 **Mark Carney’s Vision**: Moving past the US-centric top dog model. \[[43:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=2625)]  
* 🗽 **De-colonialism**: Removing 1940s-era power hierarchies.  
* 🥊 **Counter-Dictatorship**: Collective action against rogue autocrats.  
* 🧪 **Case Study**: The Biden-Blinken success in curbing precursor chemicals for fentanyl through targeted global pressure. \[[41:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=2513)]  
  
#### 🛠️ Actionable Strategy for Citizens  
  
* 🏛️ **Political Pressure**: Focus on the legislative choke points.  
* 🔢 **Margin Analysis**: Only 4 Republican Senators needed to halt specific executive actions. \[[17:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=1033)]  
* 📑 **Chipping Away**: Target appointed advisers (e.g., Miller, Kennedy Jr.) to weaken the core administration rather than focusing solely on the King. \[[49:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=2940)]  
* 🏘️ **Hyper-Local Governance**: Rebuild from the ground up.  
* 🏫 **Civic Seats**: Run for or support candidates for school boards and town meetings.  
* 📜 **State Power**: Engage state legislatures to safeguard constitutional rights.  
* 🌱 **Community Resilience**: The Minnesota Nice model. \[[28:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=1695)]  
* 🤝 **Social Cohesion**: Strengthen community bonds to resist federal overreach (e.g., ICE actions).  
* 🧘 **Mindful Action**: Cultivating seeds of peace to maintain long-term democratic vision.  
  
#### ⚖️ Governance & Accountability Mechanisms  
  
* 📜 **25th Amendment**: Requires Cabinet consensus; unlikely due to loyalty and lack of qualifications. \[[31:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=1860)]  
* 🔨 **Impeachment**: Not strictly for crimes; can be used for not doing the job or negligence. \[[32:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=1962)]  
* 🔦 **Public Testimony**: Leveraging oversight (e.g., Jack Smith's evidence) to inform voters and pressure representatives. \[[24:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZxpMWFJ6w4&t=1447)]
