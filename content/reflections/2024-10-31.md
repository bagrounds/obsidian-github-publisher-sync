# 2024-10-31 | 🪜 Linear 🏡 Living 🛣️  
## 🤔 More thoughts on [Linear Processes](../topics/linear-processes.md)  
### 🏡 Household Chores  
😩 I don't love doing dishes.  
😊 But we have a nice process that makes it easy to do a little at a time.  
🧺 Same with laundry.  
🤔 Something about this reminds me of a Kanban planning scheme I designed for work a while back.  
  
### 🚦 Kanban  
🤔 Actually, I think these are all examples of Kanban systems.  
🚦 In Kanban, the flow of work is not necessarily represented by paper cards or digital representations of sticky notes.  
🧺 A basket that moves laundry from the bedroom to the laundry room is a form of Kanban.  
➡️ Maybe these are all _[Linear Processes](../topics/linear-processes.md)_.  
  
### 🌀 Non-linear processes  
🤔 I think I tend to think of home organization as a non-linear process.  
🏠 It's big, complex, and overwhelming.  
👷 To make progress, I may need to hire experts and spend days organizing and engineering systems to maintain organization.  
🌪️ A flurry of intense activity is required in a short period of time.  
⚠️ Otherwise we may wind up with half the house inside out and unusable, making things worse.  
  
### ⚙️ System Design  
🤔 But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.  
💡 Maybe we can design an organization process that is nice in the same way that the dishes 🍽️, laundry 🧺, and Kanban planning 🚦 are nice.  
🪜 A process where incremental progress can happen a little at a time.  
🤏 Where a little work yields a little improvement.  
😌 This would make the effort a lot less overwhelming.  
👍 A lot easier.  
✅ Progress could be made.  
  
### ➡️ Linear Organization  
🤔 What would this linear home organization process look like?  
💭 I'm imagining a system that looks like combination of Kanban planning 🚦 and laundry 🧺.  
👩‍❤️‍👨 My wife and I can collect ideas on a Kanban board.  
✏️ A little at a time, we can expand and define these ideas, adding critical details about goals, outcomes, and the steps necessary to move ideas to reality.  
✅ When an idea is well fleshed out and we agree it should be done, we can start working one little step at a time.  
➡️ The execution plan should be linear to be well behaved.  
⚠️ Each step should leave the house in a state of minimal disruption.  
👚 We don't want a closet organization project paused in a way that prevents us from getting dressed on a daily basis.  
  
### 🤔 Much Ado about Planning?  
🧘 I pause and reflect.  
🤯 This feels almost revolutionary.  
🤩 Exciting.  
✨ Novel.  
😲 Wow.  
➡️ A way convert a big, overwhelming, potentially disruptive venture into a series of small, easy, safe steps to achieve a goal.  
📐 Designing _linear processes_!  
🤯 Wow. So sophisticated. The welding of abstract mathematics to tame menacing real life projects.  
❓ Or is this just planning?  
📝 Write down a goal. 쪼 Split a big project into little tasks. ✅ Complete work a bit at a time.  
🔮 Peer into the future. 🎭 Simulate activities. 🔎 Look for problems in the simulation. ✍️ Write down the steps.  
🤔 Do people do this all the time?  
🧐 Am I discovering something obvious?  
🤷 I can't tell. 🗣️ Maybe I'll ask around.  
👍 I guess it doesn't matter much for me.  
✅ Whether planning or designing linear processes is obvious to the rest of the world or not, it's useful to me.  
  
### ✍️ Blogging  
🧠 I think this is also a linear process.  
  
1. 💡 I get an idea  
2. 📱 I open my phone  
3. ✏️ I write a few words  
4. 🚀 I publish my notes  
5. 🔄 I revisit an idea  
6. ✍️ I revise prior writing  
7. 📢 I publish again  
  
📈 I can write and publish a little at a time and my website grows on its own.  
🗓️ I did a bit of planning when I started this.  
⏳ And I've done bits more over time.  
🧱 A little more structure here, ✍️ a little more writing there.  
🌱 Continuous, gradual, incremental improvement.  
😎 Pretty cool, I think.  
  
### 🧪 A Test  
⏳ Let's see how easily I can find my notes on setting up this blogging system to drop a link.  
📝 My blogs posts are currently untitled (minus the date), which makes the [Reflections](./index.md) index of limited use.  
🔎 But I can search for key terms, like "obsidian publish" and see what comes back.  
🎉 Boom second of 2 results: [2024-04-21](./2024-04-21.md). ✅ Easy.  
🥳 Thank you, me from 6 months ago! 🚀 Look what we've done! 😊  
  
👍 Okay. Enough for now. 🌅 Back to my morning routine...
