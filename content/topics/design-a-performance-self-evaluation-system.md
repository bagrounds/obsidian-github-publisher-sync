## ü¶üüîç Bug Investigation  
ü§î Why doesn't my embedded Excalidraw get converted to svg when I publish this note?  
  
### üëÄ Observations  
- there is an image element embedded in the page, but it doesn't render  
- when I view the image at its url directly, I see the following error and a blank page  
```  
This page contains the following errors:  
error on line 1 at column 1: Start tag expected, '<' not found  
Below is a rendering of the page up to the first error.  
```  
- I sometimes see the following error in an obsidian popup after publishing this note:  
```  
‚ùå Errors  
üì§ Cannot be published  
üóíÔ∏èDrawing 2024-12-12 17.20.04.excalidraw.md  
```  
- I also see this error popup when publishing this note: `ReferenceError: Buffer is not defined`  
- I've pulled the corresponding log line out of my logstravaganza plugin log file ([chat gpt cleaned it up](../bot-chats/special-characters-in-logs.md))  
```

### üßë‚Äçüî¨ Attempts  
- I've updated my GitHub publisher (now [Enveloppe](https://enveloppe.github.io)) Obsidian plugin to the latest version  
- I've updated my [Obsidian Excalidraw Plugin](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) to the latest version  
- I've tried toggling a bunch of settings in my Envelope plugin related to links and conversions  
- I've looked through Enveloppe's GitHub issue tracker for similar problems  
  - This [issue](https://github.com/Enveloppe/obsidian-enveloppe/issues/331#issuecomment-2049061420) looks close, but not quite the same  
  
###  ü§î Hypotheses  
- The Excalidraw file is being sent over as markdown instead of directly being converted to svg  
- Maybe that Buffer not defined error comes up while trying to convert the file to svg  
  - If so, the JavaScript runtime used by my mobile obsidian app may differ from the developer's test environment. But I'm already on the latest version of Obsidian.  
  
### üìé Workaround  
In the meantime, I've exported the excalidraw to svg and embedded that directly.  
This gives the same end result, but requires a suboptimal workflow: re-export the file on every change, delete the old one, and rename the new export.
