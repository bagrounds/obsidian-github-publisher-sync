## 🤖🤖📖 An AI Book Report Template  
- 💻 This is the [Obsidian](../software/obsidian.md) templater template I'm currently using for AI book reports.  
- ➕ I use the QuickAdd plugin to call the template.  
- 📱 I use the Commander plugin to put a button on my mobile toolbar  
- 🛠️ It's not a perfect work of software craftsmanship; just a practical script that streamlined and automates.  
- ✅ I think it's working pretty well!  
- ⚙️ Workflow  
    - ➕ Click the plus button on my mobile toolbar (bringing up the QuickAdd menu)  
    - 📖 Choose book from the menu  
    - 📝 Paste the name of a book (no colons due to filename restrictions) into the text box  
    - ⏳ Wait several long seconds (less than a minute, but there's a definite time delay)  
    - 💰 Profit!  
- 🤖 The template will  
    - 📄 create a new file named after the book (in kebab-case)  
    - ⚙️ set up some frontmatter (yaml at the top of the markdown file) and boilerplate text and links  
    - 🗣️ Call the Gemini API asking for a book report (see the prompt below)  
        - 💰 using a newer model with a relatively low rate limit & daily cap   
    - ✨ Send the result back to Gemini to Emojify it  
        - ⚡ using a good standard model with a very generous rate limit and daily cap  
    - 🧹 Clean up some whitespace  
    - ✏️ Insert the result into the new note  
    - 🔗 (QuickAdd adds a link to the new file wherever my cursor was)  
- ✍️ After that, I may do some light editing, pick some nice emojis for the title, etc - but it's largely ready to go  
- 🔑 All you need is a (free) Gemini API key.

## 🤪 Emojify Template  
- 🤔 Choosing and 🖱️ inserting the 👌 perfect emojis can be 😫 tedious.  
- 🥳 Luckily, ~~😈🤖Skynet~~ 😇🤖 [Gemini](../software/gemini.md) is pretty 👍 good with emojis.  
- Similar to above, I use 👨‍✈️ Commander to put a 🖲️ button with a 🎨 custom icon on my 📱 mobile toolbar  
- 👆 Select text. 🙂 Tap button. ✨ Emojify.

## 🪞 Reflections  
- ❓ How much value can we get from an AI generated 🤖 book report 📝?  
    - 🤔 Maybe 10% of the value of the full read in ...  
        - 📚 [Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present](../books/strongmen.md) is 9h 42m on audible. 🎧  
        - ⏱️ The read time plugin claims my AI book report 📝 is a 7 minute read.  
        - 🧮 (9 * 60 + 42 = 582) / 7 = 83  
    - ⏳ ... 1/83rd the time?  
    - 🚀 That's something like 8x leverage.  
    - 👍 Not bad.  
    - 🎁 And the Gemini API is free.  
- 🌐 How much value can be created by freely sharing these AI book reports 📝 online?  
    - 📈 According to the [Google Search Console](../software/google-search-console.md), traffic 🖱️ (clicks when it comes up in search results) to my website 💻 has grown from 3 per week to 23 per week over the past 3 months.  
    - 📊 That's a growth rate of (23 - 3) / 3 ~= 7 additional clicks per month.  
    - 🔮 Extrapolating with linear growth, I might have (23 + 36 x 7 =275) clicks per week 3 years from now.  
    - ➕ Integrating (summing) over time, that yields (Gemini pause for LaTex) $\sum_{i=0}^{36} (23 + 7*i)$ = 5513 (Thanks [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%5Csum_%7Bi%3D0%7D%5E%7B36%7D+%2823+%2B+7*i%29)!) clicks over the next 3 years.  
        - ☝️🐛 See the bug in this calculation?  
    - 🤓 Assuming 1% of my visitors actually read a single AI generated 🤖 book report 📝 (and the rest read nothing), that's 55 AI book reports read.  
    - 🤯 ...do I get to multiply my earlier 8x leverage per book 📚 by 55 people 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, yielding 440x?  
    - ❓ What units does this leverage take on? Book 📖 knowledge dissemination rate?  
    - 🤔 Not sure...  
    - 🗳️ Maybe that's 55 more slightly better informed voters by our next election?  
    - ❤️‍🩹 That probably won't do much on its own, but it's a contribution.  
- 🤪 Emojify! 🪄  
- 🧐 Reviews the above...  
    - 🐛 Bug report: I mixed weeks and months! 🗓️  
    - 🧮 I shouldn't be summing to 36. 🤔  
    - 🗓️ It should be 3 years x 12 months per year x 4 weeks per month (or more accurately, 📅 52 weeks per year x 3 years) = 156  
    - 📈 So $\sum_{i=0}^{156} (23 + 7*i)$ = 89,333 ! 🤯  
    - 👓 With the 1% reading rate, we now get 893 more slightly better informed voters by next election. 🗳️  
    - 😞 Which, to be honest, is qualitatively about as disappointing as 55. 😔  
    - 📍 And they're probably not in swing states. 🗺️  
    - 💻 Though maybe I could check readership by state in the Google Search Console. 😴 Not tonight though.  
- 🎯 Okay, maybe my next goal should be to figure out how to inject some exponential growth into this formula. 🚀  
    - 📈 Things grow 🚀 exponentially when they go 🦠 viral and 🗣️ people share 💌 things with their 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 friends and 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 family.  
    - 💰 Making that happen is the subject keeping many would-be 🤑 billionaires 💻 busy at 🏢 startups.  
    - 📚 But there are plenty of books on the subject...
