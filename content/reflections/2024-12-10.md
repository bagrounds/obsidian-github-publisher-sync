## 😮😊 A Surprisingly Good Day  
🤔 Why did I have a good day after a poor night's sleep?  
  
### 🎮☕📈 Control, Motivation, and Performance  
- What if self awareness, evaluation, and control are good for performance, but bad for motivation?  
- Maybe the positive feedback loop between motivation and performance can dominate the effect of control on motivation.

```  
  
### 😴 Sleep, Motivation, and Control  
Then sleep deprevation may  
- indirectly decrease performance through decreased control  
- but the decreased observation, awareness, and control may increase motivation, which increases performance, which increases motivation

```  
  
### 🎵 Music, Motivation, and Control  
Good music may decrease awareness, evaluation, and control, indirectly increasing motivation **and** increase motivation directly, yielding a powerful motivation boost.

### 🪞 Reflections  
- 🤔 Maybe focusing too much on self awareness, 🧐 evaluation, and 🕹️ control can result in a 📉 negative impact on motivation, which feeds a 🔄 vicious cycle with performance.  
- 🧭 Self awareness and 🧐 evaluation are necessary for course correction, but too much may be 🤕 crippling for motivation.  
- ⚙️ Systems thinking points to the existence of 🚀 leverage points in complex systems.  
  - 🎯 Of course, we want to find the leverage points  
  - ✅ and often we do  
  - ⚠️ but it's easy to find the lever and push in the wrong direction  
- 🕹️ Maybe self control is a lever that I've been pushing too hard.  
- 🧘 Maybe if I relax a bit, I can be less reactive to the 📢 noisy signal of performance and take a more gradual, 🕊️ gentler approach to 🕹️ control.  
- 🕹️ Control decreases motivation; use with ⚠️ caution.  
- 🎶 Music is great for motivation.  
- 😊 Mood -> 🚀 motivation -> 📈 performance  
- 🧐 Maybe this explains a bit about 🗜️ Micromanagement  
  - 😈 It's very tempting as a means of 🕹️ control  
  - 📉 But it's very demotivating, resulting in poor outcomes in the long run  
- 🧐 Maybe this also explains that weird observation in psychology where short term sleep deprevation can alleviate symptoms of 😔 depression  
  - 🧠 perhaps the sleep deprevation turns off the prefrontal cortex, which results in less self criticism and the harsh resultung impact on 🚀 motivation and 😊 mood
