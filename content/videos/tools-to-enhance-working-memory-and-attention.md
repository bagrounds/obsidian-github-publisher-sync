## Notes  
- Working memory follows an upside down U shaped function with respect to dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.  
- If dopamine levels are too low or too high, working memory suffers.  
  
## Protocols for Increasing Dopamine and Working Memory  
1. 😴 Non Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)  
  1. i.e. a 20-30 minute nap  
2. 🥶 Cold exposure  
  1. e.g. 30s - 3m cold shower  
  2. cold enough to be uncomfortable  
  3. Increases catecholamines  
  4. ⚠️ Do not hyperventilate or hold your breath while in cold water.  
3. 🎧 Binaural beats during or before tasks  
    1. Scientific studies demonstrate improvements in working memory, but not necessarily dopamine  
4. 💊 Over the counter supplements  
        1. L-tyrosine - very high doses produce a small effect; not recommended  
        2. Mucuna pruriens (L-DOPA) - discuss with your doctor; roughly equivalent to L-DOPA, a prescription drug  
5. ⚕️ Prescription drugs for ADHD  
    1. Adderall  
    2. Ritalin
