## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
⛓️ Elias gripped the cold chains, each link a dull thud against his 💓 racing heart. 👑 The inheritocracy power pulsed behind the gilded door, a vortex of inherited privilege 📜 and unspoken mandates. He'd always known it was there, a silent, all-consuming force 🌌, but to feel its tendrils now, wrapping around his very essence, was a personal shock 💥. He watched, horrified 😱, as smaller, shadowy figures, born of the same oppressive energy 🌑, began meticulously erecting transparent barriers before him. "❌ Bad Work Limits," the words glowed ✨, trapping his ambition 🚀, his innovation 💡, his very potential 🌠 behind an invisible, impenetrable wall 🧱. The air crackled with the promise of what could be ✨, suffocating under the weight of what already was 😔.
