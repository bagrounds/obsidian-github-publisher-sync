# 🧬🤖❓ Can We Build a Human? – A Question of Science with Professor Brian Cox  
![Can We Build a Human? – A Question of Science with Professor Brian Cox](https://youtu.be/zSdzLnFxMJs)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* 🧠 Cerebral organoids grown from stem cells allow us to study human brain evolution and disease in a lab setting \[[02:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=152)].  
* 🦴 Neurotechnology and spinal implants already provide voluntary movement for some individuals with paralysis \[[08:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=536)].  
* 🫀 Lab grown organs currently face physical limits because they lack a blood supply to deliver oxygen and nutrients \[[10:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=648)].  
* 💉 Bioelectronic devices can treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating peripheral nerves \[[11:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=669)].  
* 🦾 Modern robotic limbs can already surpass organic ones in strength and sensory range \[[17:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1045)].  
* 🎞️ A whole brain transplant would result in a clean slate because memories are built through lived experience \[[20:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1212)].  
* 🧬 Synthesizing a human genome from scratch remains a distant goal due to the complexity of the dark genome \[[28:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1721)].  
* 🛰️ Biological augmentation may be necessary for humans to survive long distance space travel and radiation \[[31:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1868)].  
* ⚖️ Ethical decisions regarding synthetic biology must involve the public and ethicists, not just scientists \[[22:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1361)].  
* 💰 High initial costs for new medical technologies like gene therapy typically decrease as they become standardized \[[40:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=2413)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* 🔬 While the video highlights the promise of organoids, Nature Biotechnology reports that achieving full vascularization remains the primary hurdle for creating transplantable, full scale organs.  
* 🛡️ The discussion on neural implants aligns with the ethical frameworks proposed by the Neuroethics Society, which emphasizes cognitive liberty and the risks of brain data privacy.  
* 🔭 To better understand these topics, one should explore the field of xenotransplantation and the current progress of the Human Genome Project-write (HGP-write).  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 🧠 Q: Can scientists currently grow a fully functioning human brain in a lab?  
  
🧬 A: No, researchers grow cerebral organoids which are small bits of brain tissue that lack the blood supply, maturity, and sensory input required to function as a human brain \[[12:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=771)].  
  
### 🦾 Q: Are robotic limbs currently better than biological ones?  
  
⚡ A: In terms of raw strength and processing speed, mechanical limbs can surpass human ones, but connecting them seamlessly to the human nervous system remains a challenge \[[17:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1074)].  
  
### 📝 Q: What would happen to my memories if I had a brain transplant?  
  
🧹 A: You would lose them because a lab grown brain would be a clean slate; identity and thoughts are formed through life experiences, not just biological structure \[[20:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1212)].  
  
### 🧬 Q: Is it possible to design a human by writing synthetic DNA?  
  
🧪 A: Not yet; while scientists have synthesized yeast genomes, the human genome is far more complex and contains many regions we do not yet understand \[[28:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSdzLnFxMJs&t=1736)].
