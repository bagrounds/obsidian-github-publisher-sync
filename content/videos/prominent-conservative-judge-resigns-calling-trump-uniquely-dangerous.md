![Prominent conservative judge resigns, calling Trump 'uniquely dangerous'](https://youtu.be/kMJM9ozAsPg)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
⚖️ I am resigning because the White House's assault on the rule of law is deeply disturbing, making my silence intolerable \[[00:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=5)].  
  
* 🚨 This president is unique and uniquely dangerous, overtly directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prosecute his perceived political enemies \[[00:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=55)].  
* 🛡️ The DOJ is not investigating possible corruption by those close to or profiting the president and his family, utterly inconsistent with the fundamental principle of equal justice under law \[[01:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=85)].  
* 📉 The abuse showered on the courts and judges causes people to lose confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judicial process \[[02:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=136)].  
* 🚫 Unlike Richard Nixon, who obeyed the Supreme Court, I am not confident a president today would obey a ruling because he calls judges corrupt when they rule against him \[[02:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=171)].  
* 😨 The president's vitriolic comments have coincided with threats of harm, including death threats, against many federal judges, causing anxiety for their families \[[04:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=253)].  
* 🗽 Democracy is the rule of law; if court orders are disobeyed, the president gains absolute power \[[07:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=423)].  
* 📜 Courts must hold elected officials to the limits of the power delegated to them by the people, as promised by the Constitution \[[07:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMJM9ozAsPg&t=447)].

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 🚪 Q: Why did Reagan-appointed Judge Mark Wolf resign from his lifetime judicial appointment?  
🗣️ A: Judge Wolf resigned because judicial ethics rules prevented him from speaking publicly or engaging in work outside the courtroom to combat what he views as an existential threat to democracy and the rule of law. 🎯 He felt compelled to give up his lifetime appointment to speak freely against President Trump's partisan use of the law.  
  
### 🛑 Q: What does Judge Wolf mean by the assault on the rule of law?  
⚖️ A: The assault on the rule of law refers to the president overtly directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to target political enemies while simultaneously sparing friends and family from investigation into possible corruption. 🚨 Wolf asserts this action violates the core principle of equal justice under law.  
  
### 🗽 Q: What role do courts play in protecting democracy, according to Judge Wolf?  
🛡️ A: Courts are the essential check that holds elected officials to the limits of the power delegated to them by the people, as defined by the Constitution. 🛑 If court orders can be disobeyed without consequence, the executive effectively gains absolute power, dismantling democracy itself.
