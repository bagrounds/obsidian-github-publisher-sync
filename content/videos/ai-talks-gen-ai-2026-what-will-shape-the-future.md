## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 🤖 Q: What is the main difference between agentic engineering and traditional AI assistants?  
  
🤖 A: Agentic engineering moves beyond simple code suggestions to autonomous workflows where agents plan, implement, test, and deliver complete software artifacts with human oversight limited to goal setting and risk approval.  
  
### 🧬 Q: How does polymorphic UI change the user experience?  
  
🧬 A: Unlike static, pre-designed screens, polymorphic UI uses agents to generate and adapt interface components in real-time based on the specific intent and context of the user's conversation.  
  
### 💰 Q: Why is FinOps becoming critical for generative AI in 2026?  
  
💰 A: Multi-agent and swarm systems can consume 5 to 10 times more tokens than single-query systems, making rigorous cost observation and optimization essential for maintaining business value.  
  
### 🐝 Q: What is the advantage of swarm intelligence over meta-agents?  
  
🐝 A: Swarm intelligence utilizes multiple specialized agents that coordinate based on rules without a central orchestrator, often leading to more reliable and proven results through collective conclusion-gathering.
