![WATCH: Sen. Merkley concludes marathon 22-hour speech protesting Trump amid shutdown](https://youtu.be/VKuysbYR1KQ)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
The video captures the conclusion of a nearly 23-hour **marathon speech** delivered on the Senate floor. The address was a **protest** against the President's conduct and the ongoing **government shutdown**.  
  
* 🚨 **Authoritarianism** is here now, not merely around the corner.  
* ⚠️ **President Trump** is shredding the Constitution, which is the biggest threat to the republic since the Civil War.  
* 🚔 **Federal military deployments** are occurring in cities like Portland, Oregon, over the objections of local leaders.  
* ⚖️ The power of the government is being deployed to go after individuals perceived to be **political opponents**, demonstrating **unequal injustice** instead of equal justice under law.  
* 💸 The plan is to replace a government **by and for the people** with a government **by and for the powerful**.  
* 📰 There are reported **attacks on the press** and a politicization of the Justice Department.  
* 🏥 The **government shutdown** is a strategy to continue slashing Americans' health care.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* 📉 **Weighing the Economic Impact of the Shutdown:** The senator's protest occurred on the 22nd day of the government shutdown. 📊 Third-party analysis from the **Congressional Budget Office** (CBO) on the similar, longer shutdown of 2018-2019 estimated an $11 billion cost to the U.S. economy, with a permanent loss of about $3 billion. 💰 This CBO data supports the claim that the shutdown carries a *high cost* to the nation, irrespective of the political intent claimed by the speaker (slashing health care) or his opponents (patting themselves on the back).  
* ⚖️ **Weighing the Claim of Constitutional Crisis:** The speech strongly asserted that President Trump was *“shredding our constitution”* and that the country was in the *“most perilous moment...since the civil war”*. 📚 The presence of the book *How Democracies Die* on the lectern further contextualizes the claim within academic literature on democratic erosion by elected leaders, supporting the speaker's chosen framework. 🏛️ While the CBO provides data on economic harm, organizations like **The Brookings Institution** focus on the structural harms of shutdowns, noting they weaken institutional functions and public perception of government effectiveness, which lends weight to the notion of *institutional damage* that goes beyond policy disputes.  
* 🗣️ **Contrast with Political Counter-Arguments:** Republican Senate leadership dismissed the speech as *“rubbish”* and ineffective. 🛠️ The core Republican counter-argument, as documented by the **Associated Press**, was that the speech forced **unpaid Capitol support staff** to work overtime, thus aggravating the harm of the shutdown on federal workers.  
  
* 🔎 **Topics to Explore for a Better Understanding:**  
    * 📜 **The Constitutional Role of Floor Speeches:** Investigating the history and efficacy of marathon Senate speeches, which, like this one, are not technical **filibusters** but serve as a means of political protest to raise public awareness.  
    * 📰 **The Legality of Federal Deployments:** Examining the legal arguments made by both the administration and local authorities regarding the deployment of federal agents or the National Guard to U.S. cities.
