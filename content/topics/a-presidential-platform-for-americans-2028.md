# 🇺🇸🗣️💡🗓️ A Presidential Platform for Americans 2028  
  
## 📢 The Opportunity  
- 👹 Donald Trump has taught us that  
    - 🇺🇸 Americans want change  
    - 🏛️ Presidents wield immense power  
- 💥 As his abuses of power flood the country with violence and corruption, the rising American will for positive change presents a unique opportunity to elect a leader to wield this immense power for good.

## 🌍 Foreign Policy

    - 🛡️ in self defense, always

- 🏠 Good neighbors are good for the homeland

        - 🆘 How can we help our neighbors solve these problems?  
        - 🗳️ Public approval is required for costly foreign aid.

## 💡 Ideas  
  
### 💼 The Job Guarantee  
- 🚀 Effective immediately, the federal government guarantees a job to anyone willing to work.  
    - 📉 Involuntary unemployment goes to zero.  
    - 💪 Millions of workers mobilize to improve the nation.  
- 🇺🇸 Make America Great.  
    - 🥇 We will finally step into our oft purported role as the greatest nation on earth by offering the best guaranteed benefits in the world.  
- ⚖️ The wages and benefits of the job guarantee immediately become a minimum bar to employing people in America by forcing private businesses to compete with new minimum standards without the need for explicit laws or regulations.  
    - ✅ The benefits  
        - 🍔 Food

    - 🗳️ Implement community led public works projects  
  
### 📱 Public Tech  
#### 🌐 Social Media  
- 👎 Private social media companies sold out the American people.  
- 🚫 There's no reason to continue to allow Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump to amass obscene personal wealth by empowering foreign governments, wealthy elites, and ideological zealots to spread propaganda and lies over today's most prevalent mass communication platforms.  
- 💻 Social media technology is easy to build and maintain.  
- 📢 A public social media platform will  
    - 🆓 be free  
    - 🆔 tie participation to government verified identity  
    - 🚫 not sell advertising  
    - 🔬 support, direct, and leverage research on algorithms that improve social cohesion rather than inspiring hate and division  
    - 💻 build free and open source software in the public domain  
    - 👁️ operate transparently  
    - 🗳️ self govern, democratically  
  
#### 🚗 Gig Platform  
- 🚫 We need not allow Uber, et. al. to siphon wealth from workers and consumers on every transaction made on the only viable gig work platforms.  
- 📢 A public gig work platform will  
    - 🏛️ allow the federal government to subsidize labor that supports public service goals, such as childcare and education  
    - 💰 allow workers to keep 100% of their earned revenue  
  
#### 📚 Digital Library  
- 🔎 Identify the best educational materials: books, audio, videos, games, etc  
- 🤝 Buy the rights from authors as necessary to put them in the public domain  
- 🆓 Offer them for free, without limits, to all Americans via a public digital distribution platform  
- ✍️ Allow content creators to publish new material for sale on the platform  
    - ✅ As new material breaches a popularity threshold and passes a quality audit, buy the rights from the author, move it into the public domain, and remove the cost of access  
  
#### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence and Robotics 🚀  
- 💰 As private corporations develop increasingly advanced AI and robotics, they wield immense power, accumulate massive profits 💸, and lay off millions of displaced workers 😥.  
- 🤔 Instead of allowing a few billionaires 🤑 to secure unregulated access to the world's most powerful technologies 💻 with a mandate to maximize shareholder profits, let's ensure that these revolutionary technologies are used carefully 🤝 in order to serve the public interest 🌍 without threatening the livelihoods of workers everywhere 🧑‍🏭.  
- 🏛️ The federal government will hire the world's best 🔬 scientists and engineers 👩‍💻 to maintain the cutting edge of innovation ✨.  
- ⚖️ We will continuously evaluate the power of these technologies 📊 and regulate their private use accordingly 📜.  
  
### 📊 Patriot Metrics  
- 💰 Today we measure, mandate, and reward the hoarding of private profits and generate massive inequality.  
- ⚖️ In order to balance the scales, let's begin by measuring patriotism.  
- 🇺🇸 Patriot metrics measure the degree to which businesses improve the lives of their employees, customers, and communities.  
- 🚀 Patriot metrics can drive change by  
    - 📢 spreading awareness, which allows individuals to support patriotic businesses and pressure greedy businesses to change  
    - 🏛️ enabling tax policies that incentivize patriotism  
    - 🔎 allowing for the study, identification, and regulation of extremely unpatriotic practices  
- ✅ Examples  
    - 💰 Measure the Geni coefficient across every employee of a business to see how well they distribute wealth internally  
    - 📈 Measure the change of wealth distribution over time of a business' owners, customers, and surrounding communities to yield insights into exploitative pricing, lasting product and service value, and community impact  
    - 🗳️ Measure elected representatives by their donors and impact of policy positions to unveil deceptive politicians working for private interests.  
  
### 🍎 Food Security  
- 💸 Money doesn't grow on trees, but food does.  
- 🤝 Give people SNAP benefits; feed them for a political cycle. 🌱 Invest in sustainable micro-agriculture, community gardens, and efficient food supply, distribution, and composting infrastructure and education; feed them for generations.

### 🏘️ Housing for All  
- 🏗️ Build housing. Lots of it. Everywhere.  
- 🚫 Ban corporate ownership of housing.  
- 🏦 Tax land to disincentivize hoarding and inefficient use.  
  
### 🌠👶 Universal Childcare  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 We will support parents and children from birth until they begin public school with  
    - 🤰 guaranteed paid parental leave (job guarantee benefits)  
    - 🍎 public preschool  
    - 👶 subsidized babysitting (public tech: gig platform)  
  
### 🗳️ Dynamic Democratic Policy Proposals  
- 🗣️ Support policy proposals and debate on public social media.  
- 🇺🇸 All Americans are free to propose and debate policy ideas.  
- 🧑‍🔬 Experts employed by the federal government participate in vetting when proposals reach a threshold of popular support.  
- 💡 Ad-hoc competitions can be sponsored to generate and hone ideas for solutions to the country's most pressing issues.  
  
### 📊 Continuous Transparent Public Polling  
- 📈 Support ad hoc and systematic polling on public social media.  
- ❤️ Maintain a continuous, accurate pulse 💓 on public sentiment for all aspects of government performance.  
- 👂 Government monitors sentiment and adjusts operations based on feedback.  
  
### 💲🧑‍🧑‍🧒‍🧒 Pay Mothers  
- 📈 Estimates suggest that mothers do the equivalent of $170,000 of unpaid labor per year.  
- 💸 Mainstream economics has nothing to say about the most valuable role in society.  
- 🏛️ The federal government will pay mothers for the work that markets fail to acknowledge.  
- 🚀 This will lift millions of children 🧒, women 👩, and families 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 out of poverty, eliminate dependence on various forms of welfare 📉, and empower women.  
- 🍎 Inflation can be addressed by government programs to expand the supply of food 🍎, housing 🏠, healthcare 🏥, transportation 🚗, and other essential goods mothers are likely to spend their salaries on.  
- 🌍 This will also significantly reduce extreme wealth inequality.  
  
### 💼 4 Day Work Week  
- 📉 Widespread mass corporate layoffs demonstrate that businesses don't need as much labor as they used to.  
- ✨ Let's leverage progress in automation and productivity 🤖 to increase the quality of life for all Americans.  
- 🤝 Allow anyone to voluntarily work in the job guarantee program for pay 💰 on a day off.  
- 🔄 Allows for variety in work (e.g. an office worker can get regular outdoor exercise working in a community garden or construction project without sacrificing income)  
- 🏘️ Massively increases participation in community and public focused work.
