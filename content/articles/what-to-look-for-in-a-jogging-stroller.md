# 👀👶🏼🏃🏼‍♀️🛣️ [What to Look for in a Jogging Stroller](https://www.consumerreports.org/babies-kids/strollers/jogging-stroller-what-to-look-for-a1118048843)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
When shopping for a **jogging stroller** 👶 🛒, there are a few key features to keep in mind to keep your child safe and your run smooth 🏃‍♀️. Here’s what CR recommends:  
  
- ⚙️ **Wheel Design:** True jogging strollers have three large wheels 🛞 🛞 🛞, with the front wheel locked straight for stability while running. Some models let you switch the front wheel between locked (for jogging) and swivel (for everyday use).  
- ⚖️ **Weight:** Jogging strollers can weigh 24 to 43 pounds. Make sure to check both the stroller’s weight and the maximum child weight it supports, so you know how long you’ll be able to use it.  
- 🔒 **Harness:** Look for a five-point harness for the best safety. It should be easy for you to use but tough for little hands to unfasten, and the straps should be adjustable and securely anchored.  
- 🖐️ **Handle:** The handle should be comfortable and ideally height-adjustable. A wrist strap 🎽 is a great safety feature to prevent the stroller from getting away from you.  
- 🛑 **Brakes:** Good brakes are essential. Hand-operated brakes offer better control while running, but foot brakes are common too.  
- ☀️ **Canopy:** A large, adjustable canopy protects your child from sun 🌞 and light rain 🌧️, and a peekaboo window 👀 is a nice touch for keeping an eye on your little one.
