* 🛑 Local police are forced into dangerous situations as federal tactics incite crowds and escalate minor incidents into riots \[[14:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ws1r6CaSXs&t=849)].  
* 🌫️ Agents deploy tear gas and pepper balls into public parks and crowds, affecting bystanders and local officers \[[18:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ws1r6CaSXs&t=1127)].

* 📉 Operations targeting deportations frequently result in the arrest of US citizens rather than intended targets \[[21:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ws1r6CaSXs&t=1262)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* ⚖️ While Chief Bovino argues these tactics are necessary for deterrence and safety, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) notes that Border Patrol operates with a 100-mile zone authority that often challenges Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches.  
* 📋 Contrast this aggressive approach with the more methodical strategies previously used by ICE, which prioritized high-threat targets over rapid shows of force.  
* 🔍 Research the specific legal boundaries of Border Patrol's jurisdiction in non-border states to better understand the limits of federal police power.
