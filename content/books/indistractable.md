# Indistractable  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life Summary 🧠  
**📚 TLDR:** 🧘 Become "indistractable" by 🧠 mastering internal triggers, ⏱️ making time for traction, 🛠️ hacking back external triggers, and 🤝 preventing distraction with pacts, ultimately allowing you to 🎯 live a life aligned with your values.  
  
### A Surprising Perspective 🤯  
🧠 Nir Eyal's "Indistractable" offers a fresh perspective by framing ⚠️ distraction not as a battle against external forces, but as a 😫 struggle with internal discomfort. It emphasizes 💡 understanding and managing internal triggers—the 😔 uncomfortable emotions that drive us to distraction—rather than solely focusing on external distractions like 🔔 notifications or 📱 social media. This reframing is 🤔 surprising because it shifts the 🕹️ locus of control from external factors to 🧘 internal self-regulation, which is often overlooked in traditional productivity advice.

    * 👥 Social pacts, where you commit to others to stay focused. 🙏  
  
* 🎓 **Thesis & Mental Models:**  
    * 🤔 The core thesis is that distraction is primarily an internal struggle, not an external one. 🧠
