* 📢 They framed \[[07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=440)] the New Deal as socialism \[[07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=440)] and denounced its beneficiaries - specifically black people, brown people, and women \[[07:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=462)] - as undeserving \[[15:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=948)] of tax dollars.

* 💸 This 40-50 \[[49:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=2971)] year effort aims to overturn American democracy \[[27:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1648)] and replace it with a kleptocracy \[[27:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1657)], where a small group deliberately uses state functions to enrich themselves \[[27:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1678)].

## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* 📢 The video’s assertion of an immediate, organized political opposition is historically consistent. 📈 A bipartisan conservative coalition formed in Congress by 1937, led by conservative Democrats and Republicans who opposed executive plans and New Deal taxation.  
* 🚨 The claim of an unfolding kleptocracy \[[27:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1657)] is supported by contemporary analysis. 🔎 Analysts at the SNF Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins track a Kleptocracy Tracker Timeline documenting the use of public office to advance private gain. ⚖️ While many sources agree the US exhibits alarming kleptocratic tendencies, such as regulatory capture and the political influence of big money, the country is generally not yet defined as a pure, full-fledged kleptocracy, according to RepresentUs.  
* 🗺️ Topics to explore further include the economic effectiveness of the New Deal, as historians debate if it stymied or accelerated recovery, and the full scope of how global illicit financial flows enable domestic political corruption in the United States, as documented in reports by the Center for American Progress.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### ❓ Q: What is the historical origin of the opposition to the Social Security Act and business regulation?  
💰 A: The opposition \[[06:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=414)] originated primarily among wealthy businessmen in the 1950s \[[06:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=414)] who objected to both the taxation \[[07:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=431)] required to fund social safety nets and the government regulation \[[07:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=423)] of corporate activity established by the New Deal.  
  
### ❓ Q: Why is the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision historically critical?  
⚖️ A: The Supreme \[[26:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1613)] Court's July 2024 ruling on presidential immunity is deemed the most important thing since the nation's founding \[[27:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1620)] because it is argued to destroy the core foundational concept \[[27:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1626)] of checks and balances upon which American democracy was established \[[27:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1626)].  
  
### ❓ Q: What is a kleptocracy and how does it relate to current American politics?  
💸 A: A kleptocracy \[[27:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1657)] literally means rule by thieves; it is a system where a small ruling group deliberately uses the functions of the state \[[27:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1678)] to systematically enrich themselves \[[27:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AJHeeVhQk&t=1678)]. 🚨 Some analysts suggest the US displays kleptocratic tendencies, characterized by political decisions favoring private interests over the public good.
