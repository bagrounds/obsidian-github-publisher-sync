    * **Mr. Market:** The market is personified as "Mr. Market," an emotional and often irrational business partner who offers to buy or sell stocks at varying prices. Investors should take advantage of his irrationality rather than being swayed by it. 🎭📈📉

* **Mental Models:**  
    * **The Enterprise vs. the Stock:** Graham distinguishes between the underlying business (the enterprise) and its stock price, emphasizing that investors should focus on the former. 🏢📈  
    * **Active vs. Defensive Investor:** Graham classifies investors into two categories: the defensive investor, who seeks a safe and simple approach, and the active investor, who is willing to put in more time and effort for potentially higher returns. 🛡️💪📈
