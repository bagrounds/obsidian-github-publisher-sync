# Tiny Habits  
_The Small Changes That Change Everything_  
  
## Behavior model  
### Model  
- Prompt  
    - <- {0, 1}  
    - binary variable  
    - if not prompted, behavior will not occur  
- Motivation  
    - <- [0, 1]  
    - positively correlated with likelihood of behavior  
    - motivation is fickle and can't generally be relied upon  
    -   
- Ability  
    - <- [0, 1]  
    - positively correlated with likelihood of behavior  
    - behaviors can be made easier by  
        - scaling down  
        - starter steps  
        - repetition  
  
Let B = Likelihood of behavior occurring  
B = M * A * P  
  
### Implications  
- If you want a behavior to occur  
    - ensure there is a prompt at the right place and time  
    - when motivation is low, ensure the behavior is easy  
- if you want a behavior not to occur  
    - remove the prompts when possible  
    - when motivation is high, ensure the behavior is difficult  
  
## Prompts  
### People Prompts  
- internal cues  
- examples  
    - stomach growls  
    - have to pee  
    - just remember  
- when evolutionary adapted for survival -> reliable  
- otherwise -> extremely unreliable  
### Context Prompts  
- examples  
    - alarms  
    - reminders  
    - Todo lists  
    - sticky notes  
    -   
  
### Action Prompts (anchors)  
- after I do X, I will do Y  
- behavior sequencing  
    - what comes after what?  
    - like a computer program  
    -   
  
## Celebration  
- After performing a tiny habit, celebrate.  
- Emotions create habits  
- This   
  
## Rehearsal  
Celebrate 3 times.  
When remembering to do habit  
While doing habit  
Immediately after habit
