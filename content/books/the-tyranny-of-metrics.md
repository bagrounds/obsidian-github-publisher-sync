## 🤖 AI Summary  
### The Tyranny of Metrics: Summary & Analysis 📏  
**TL;DR:** Metrics, when used without careful consideration of their limitations and unintended consequences, can lead to perverse outcomes, erode professional judgment, and undermine the very goals they are intended to serve.  
  
**New/Surprising Perspective 🤯:** This book challenges the often unquestioned assumption that "what gets measured gets managed" by demonstrating how an overreliance on metrics can incentivize manipulation, gaming the system, and a focus on easily measurable outputs rather than meaningful outcomes. It reveals how the pursuit of quantifiable targets can actually degrade performance and ethical behavior, offering a critical look at the dark side of data-driven management.
