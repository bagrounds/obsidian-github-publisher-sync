# 🤔💡🔄 The surprising habits of original thinkers  
![The surprising habits of original thinkers | Adam Grant | TED](https://youtu.be/fxbCHn6gE3U)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
The 🔑 video identifies three surprising habits of **Originals**—non-conformists who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them \[[01:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=79)].  
  
* 🕰️ **Procrastination** is a vice when it comes to productivity but it can be a virtue for creativity \[[07:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=442)].  
* 🧠 **Moderate procrastinators** are 16% more creative than the other groups because the task remains active in the back of the mind, allowing for the **incubation** of divergent ideas and non-linear thought \[[05:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=307)].  
* 🐌 **Originals are quick to start but slow to finish** \[[07:28](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=448)].  
* 🚫 The **first mover advantage** is mostly a myth because first movers had a failure rate of 47% compared with only 8% for improvers \[[08:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=485)].  
* 💡 To be original, one does not have to be first; one just has to be **different and better** \[[08:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=514)].  
* 😰 **Originals feel the same fear and doubt** as everyone else but they manage it differently \[[09:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=544)].  
* 🛑 **Self-doubt is paralyzing**, which leads one to freeze, but **idea doubt is energizing**, which motivates one to test and refine \[[09:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=565)].  
* 🌐 People who take the initiative to **doubt the default**—like downloading a non-pre-installed web browser—significantly outperform those who accept the default \[[10:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=640)].  
* 👀 **Vuja Day** is the moment one looks at something familiar and suddenly sees it with fresh eyes \[[11:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=675)].  
* 🧗 The fear that sets originals apart is not the fear of failing but the **fear of failing to try** (inaction) \[[12:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=720)].  
* ⚖️ **Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas** because the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most \[[13:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=785)].  
* 🔢 **The key to mastery is sheer volume of output**—the more one turns out, the better the chances of stumbling on something truly original \[[13:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=823)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* 🔄 **This perspective contrasts** sharply with conventional productivity advice that champions immediate action and minimizing delays \[[07:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=453)]. 🚀 The prevailing entrepreneurial ethos often rewards speed and being first, making the speaker's claim about the **First Mover Advantage** a controversial and worthwhile challenge to explore.  
* 🧐 **The distinction between Self-Doubt and Idea Doubt** is a powerful psychological tool for reframing failure, shifting the focus from personal inadequacy ("I'm crap") to the necessary imperfection of the current work ("The first few drafts are always crap") \[[09:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxbCHn6gE3U&t=581)].  
* 💡 **For a better understanding**, one should explore the specific fields where the first mover advantage still dominates, such as platform technology or patent-heavy industries, to contextualize the speaker's claim.  
* 📚 **Further exploration** could involve studying the psychological mechanisms behind the **incubation effect** during moderate procrastination to determine if the benefit is universal or contingent on the task's complexity or creative requirements.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
* **Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World by Adam Grant** - 📖 A direct, deeper dive into the research and stories mentioned in the talk, providing expanded context for the principles of procrastination, doubt, and volume.  
* **[👤📈🎯🌟🔑🤝🏆 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](../books/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people.md) by Stephen Covey** - 🎯 A contrasting perspective that emphasizes proactive behavior and putting first things first, which would challenge the creative utility of procrastination.  
* **[0️⃣➡️1️⃣ Zero To One](../books/zero-to-one.md): Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future by Peter Thiel** - 🚀 A related work that argues for the necessity of creating a monopoly (being a "Zero to One" first mover) rather than merely being an "improver" ("One to N"), offering a strong counter-argument to the "First Mover Advantage is a Myth" idea.  
* **The Art of Innovation by Tom Kelley** - 🛠️ A book that explores the methods of the design firm IDEO, focusing on generating a high volume of diverse ideas ("Fail often to succeed sooner"), which aligns with the volume principle of originals.
