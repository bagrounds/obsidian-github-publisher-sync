"The Mountain Is You: Transforming Self-Sabotage into Self-Mastery" by Brianna Wiest 👩‍💼 explores the ways individuals obstruct their own paths to 🛤️ happiness and fulfillment. 🏔️ Using the metaphor of a mountain, Wiest suggests that the biggest obstacles we face are not external circumstances, but 👤 internal struggles, 😟 fears, and self-sabotaging behaviors 🚫.
