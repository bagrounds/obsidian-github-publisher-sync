* 🏥 The discussion on skill regression after diagnosis aligns with findings from the National Autistic Society regarding the exhaustion of long-term masking.  
* 🔍 To better understand the medical transition mentioned in the video, viewers should explore the history of the DSM-5 change that consolidated Asperger’s into Autism Spectrum Disorder.
