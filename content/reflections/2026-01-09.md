## 💧 Water When Tired  
- ⭕ **Pool: Accumulate** Stop. Stay still. Gather resources until they overflow.  
- 📉 **Path: Glide** Yield. Drop resistance. Follow the easiest downward slope.  
- 🧊 **Ice: Crystallize** Freeze. Rely on rigid habits when you lack flow.  
- 🌊 **Current: Merge** Attach. Join a moving system. Let the momentum carry you.  
- 🌫️ **Mist: Evaporate** Dissolve. Lighten your presence. Drift until you are ready to condense.  
- ⏳ **Drip: Persist** Pulse. Abandon force for rhythm. Small strikes carve stone.  
- 🌿 **Dew: Settle** Rest. Stop traveling. Simply exist where you are.
