## 🤖 AI Summary  
### TL;DR 🎯  
  
📢 Surveillance capitalism, 👨‍💻👩‍💻 pioneered by Google 🔎 and now widespread 🌐, is a novel 💡 economic 💰 logic that unilaterally ☝️ claims private 🔑 human 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 experience 💭 as free 🎁 raw material 🧱 for translation 🔄 into behavioral 📊 data, which is then used to create predictive 🔮 products 📦 that are traded 🤝 in behavioral futures markets 📈📉, impacting 💥 individuals 🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️ and societies 🏘️ with profound 🤯 and often undemocratic 🗳️ consequences ⚠️.  
  
### New or Surprising Perspective 🤔  
  
Zuboff's book offers a paradigm shift in understanding the digital economy. It moves beyond concerns about privacy violations to expose a deeper, more insidious logic: the 💰 **commodification of human experience** itself. 🤯 It reveals that companies are not just interested in *knowing* us, but in 🔮 *predicting* and even 🤖 *modifying* our behavior for profit, often without our 🙈 awareness or consent. This framing challenges conventional notions of capitalism, 💸 freedom, and 🏛️ democracy in the digital age. 🕊️
