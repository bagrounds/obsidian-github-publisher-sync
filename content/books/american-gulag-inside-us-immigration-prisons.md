### 👨‍💼 Author's Perspective  
  
✍️ Mark Dow, a 📰 journalist, approaches the subject through 📍 on-the-ground reporting and a 🎯 focus on personal narratives to make the impact of immigration detention 🖐 palpable to the reader. His stated purpose was to "✍️ leave a record" of the immigration detention system that the 🇺🇸 U.S. government preferred to keep 🙈 hidden.
