* [00:00:21] The effect is divided into three stages, and many people fail to achieve their goals because they get stuck in the first two. 🚧

* [00:13:35] Critics point out that the original research doesn't show the popular graph.  graph. 📊  
* [00:13:46] The original research has a graph that looks a little bit more like this [00:13:55]  
* [00:14:09] However, numerous studies support the core concept of overestimating confidence and poor self-assessment of skill. ✅
