# Hyperfocus  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### Hyperfocus: How to Manage Your Attention in a World of Distraction 🧠  
**TL;DR:** Intentionally manage your attention by switching between hyperfocus (intense focus on a single task) and scatterfocus (deliberate mind wandering) to enhance productivity and creativity.  
  
**A New or Surprising Perspective 🤯:**  
* Unlike many productivity books that solely emphasize relentless focus, "Hyperfocus" advocates for the strategic use of *both* focused and unfocused attention.

* It also emphasizes that productivity isn't always about output, but also about creative input, and that scatterfocus is essential for that.
