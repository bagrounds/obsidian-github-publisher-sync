## 🤖 AI Summary  
📈 AI-driven traffic has 🚀 increased by 527% between January and May 2025.  
- 🎯 The report from Previsible indicates a 🔍 significant and rapid shift in web traffic due to AI platforms.  
- 💡 This surge is not a future possibility, but a current reality.  
- 🤖 AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot are influencing user discovery.

- ⚖️ These include Legal, 💰 Finance, 💼 SMB, 🛡️ Insurance, and ⚕️ Health, which account for 55% of all LLM-sourced sessions.  
- 📜 The traditional SEO playbook is becoming outdated.  
- 🔄 Content now needs to be clear, structured, and genuinely helpful to be "instantly surfaced" by AI models.  
- 🧠 Marketers must change their mindset from "ranking" to "being selected."  
- 📊 The recommendation is for marketers to begin tracking LLM-driven sessions.
