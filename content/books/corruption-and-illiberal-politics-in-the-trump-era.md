### A New or Surprising Perspective 🌟    
This book stands out by applying anthropological and comparative methods to dissect Trump-era politics—not merely as isolated scandals but as part of a broader pattern where late capitalism, cultural values, and anti‐democratic rhetoric interlock.

### Critical Analysis ⚖️

It has received praise from leading academics (e.g., endorsements by figures such as Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Michael Taussig) for its innovative approach and depth. While its dense, multi-essay format may challenge readers new to anthropological analysis, its empirical case studies and comparative frameworks make its arguments compelling and well-supported by both qualitative and quantitative research.
