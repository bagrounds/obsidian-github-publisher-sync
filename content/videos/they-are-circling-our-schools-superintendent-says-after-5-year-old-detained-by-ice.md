* 🛡️ **Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison** filed a federal lawsuit in **January 2026** alleging that the **Operation Metro Surge** deployment of thousands of agents violates the **Tenth Amendment** by interfering with state policing and school operations, as detailed in an official release from the **City of Minneapolis**.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 🧒 Q: What are the specific details regarding the detention of 5-year-old Liam Ramos in Minnesota?  
  
🧒 A: Liam Ramos, a preschool student in the Columbia Heights school district, was detained by ICE agents in his own driveway on January 20, 2026, shortly after returning home from school; despite local residents offering to take custody of the child, federal agents transported him and his father to a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas.  
  
### 🏫 Q: Are federal immigration agents legally permitted to conduct enforcement actions on school property or at bus stops?  
  
🏫 A: Following the rescinding of protected areas guidelines in early 2025, federal agents have been reported circling schools and following buses; however, legal experts from the ACLU of Pennsylvania note that schools generally require a judicial warrant signed by a judge, rather than a self-issued administrative warrant, to allow agents access to non-public areas of a campus.  
  
### 📜 Q: Do public school districts in the United States have a legal obligation to check the immigration status of enrolling students?  
  
📜 A: No, under the 1982 Supreme Court ruling in Plyler v. Doe, public schools are prohibited from denying enrollment based on immigration status and are legally barred from asking for documentation regarding a student's legal standing during the registration process.  
  
### 🏠 Q: How has the recent surge in immigration enforcement affected student attendance and school operations in the Twin Cities?  
  
🏠 A: The enforcement surge, known as Operation Metro Surge, has caused student attendance to drop by over 30% in some districts as families transition to remote learning out of fear; in response, school districts like Columbia Heights and Minneapolis have expanded online options and increased staff presence at bus stops to ensure child safety.
