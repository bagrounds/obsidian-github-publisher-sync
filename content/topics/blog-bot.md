# ✍🏽🤖 Blog Bot  
## 👥 People  
- Blogger  
- Readers  
  
## 💰 Value Proposition  
- Reduce blogger's time spent blogging  
- Increase quantity of content for readers  
  
## 🖼️ Context  
- I blog daily  
    - from my phone  
    - using obsidian  
    - I have obsidian sync  
    - and want to maintain access to all content via the same systems  
- much of my content is AI generated book summaries  
    - each book summary includes a section that refers to related books  
    - and each book report includes an Amazon affiliate link  
- while I have automated and streamlined much of the process, I still spend some minutes per book report generated, mostly doing repetitive, tedious tasks.  
- This process is semiautomatic.  
- Gemini API free tier provides a fixed number of requests per day.  
  
## 💡 Ideas  
- Fully Automatic Blogging  
    - A program autonomously generates and publishes book reports to my site  
  
## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria  
- Full autonomy  
- Integration
