# Heterodox Economics  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
**High-Level Summary:**  
Heterodox economics is a diverse and critical body of economic thought that challenges the mainstream neoclassical synthesis. It moves beyond assumptions of rational choice, market efficiency, and equilibrium, focusing on real-world complexities like power, institutions, history, social relations, and uncertainty. 🧐 It aims to provide alternative explanations for economic phenomena and address pressing issues like inequality, financial instability, and environmental degradation. 🌍 Within this diverse field, theories like Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) are gaining traction, further challenging conventional ideas about government finance and macroeconomic policy. 💰 Ultimately, heterodox economics seeks a more realistic and inclusive understanding of how economies work and impact society. 🤝
