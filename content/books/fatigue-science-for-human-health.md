### ℹ️ Overview  
  
* 📚 *Fatigue Science for Human Health* emerged from papers presented at the International Conference on Fatigue Science in 2002 (Sweden) and 2005 (Japan).  
* 🎯 The book aims to consolidate achievements in fatigue research, explain the current understanding of fatigue, and offer perspectives on remedies for chronic fatigue and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).  
* 🔬 It delves into the molecular and neural mechanisms of fatigue.  
* 👨‍⚕️ The work is intended as a resource for physicians and public health professionals.  
* ⚠️ It highlights the complexity of fatigue due to its varied causes and the, as yet, not fully elucidated molecular and neural mechanisms.  
  
### 🔑 Key Content Areas  
  
* 📏 **Dimensions and Assessment of Fatigue:** This section likely covers how fatigue is defined, measured, and the reliability of various assessment scales. 📝 It addresses the need for validated scales, particularly for CFS, that can capture multiple dimensions of fatigue and its severity.  
* 🌍 **Epidemiology and Social/Industrial Aspects:** This area explores the prevalence of fatigue in the general population and its societal and economic impacts. 🚻 It may also touch upon gender differences in fatigue-related illnesses.  
* 🧠 **Mechanisms of Fatigue:** The book discusses the molecular and neural underpinnings of fatigue. 🤯 This could include topics like the role of sustained stress and its impact on concentration, energy, and sleep.  
* 🎗️ **Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS):** A significant focus is on CFS, including its diagnosis, potential causes (e.g., viral infections), and management. 🧪 The book likely presents research on understanding and treating this complex condition.
