## 🤖 AI Summary  
🧹 **Summary**  
🌊 "How to Keep House While Drowning" is a brief, 💖 compassionate guide aimed at those who feel 😥 overwhelmed by the demands of 🏠 housekeeping—especially when 🧠 mental health challenges like 🧠 ADHD, 😔 depression, or 🤰 postpartum struggles are in play. 🔄 KC Davis reframes 🏠 housework as a series of 💖 functional care tasks rather than ⚖️ moral tests. 🚫 Instead of measuring your worth by how ✨ spotless your home is, the book encourages you to adopt a 💖 gentle, 🤗 self-compassionate approach where ✅ “good enough is perfect.”

- 🔄 **Reframe Housework:** 👀 View cleaning and organizing as 😐 neutral tasks meant to support your daily life rather than as markers of personal 💔 failure.  
- 🫂 **Embrace Imperfection:** 🙌 Adopt the mindset that you don’t need a perfectly ✨ pristine home—🏠 maintaining functionality is what truly 💖 matters.  
- 🧩 **Break Tasks Down:** 🪜 Use strategies like the “Five Things Tidying Method” to split 🧺 chores into manageable categories (🗑️ trash, 🍽️ dishes, 🧺 laundry, 📦 items with a designated place, and ❓ items without one).  
- 🧘 **Prioritize Rest and Self-Care:** 😴 Understand that rest is a ✅ right, not a 🏆 reward, and that taking ☕ breaks can actually 🚀 boost your overall productivity.
