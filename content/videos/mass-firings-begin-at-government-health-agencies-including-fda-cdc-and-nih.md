## ðŸ¤– AI Summary  
- **Scope of Firings:** Thousands of staff were terminated across various key agencies, including the FDA, CDC, and NIH \[[00:00](https://youtu.be/oJn5Q5Y-SX8&t=0)].  
- **Areas Affected:** At the CDC, cuts impacted areas beyond infectious disease, such as tobacco control, injury prevention, and reproductive health \[[00:49](https://youtu.be/oJn5Q5Y-SX8&t=49)]. The FDA saw the removal of individuals involved in reviewing new medical products, as well as leaders in vaccine development and the tobacco center \[[00:58](https://youtu.be/oJn5Q5Y-SX8&t=58)].

- **Efficiency vs. Expertise:** While some acknowledge the existence of bureaucratic inefficiencies within HHS \[[02:16](https://youtu.be/oJn5Q5Y-SX8&t=136)], there are concerns about whether the changes will truly increase efficiency or negatively impact essential functions \[[02:45](https://youtu.be/oJn5Q5Y-SX8&t=165)].
