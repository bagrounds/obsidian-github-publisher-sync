![Urge Surfing Demonstration and Explanation by a Therapist | Effectively manage cravings and urges](https://youtu.be/ASG1c1EqXyc)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
🌊 Urge surfing is a core 💡 skill used to manage intense cravings or desires to perform undesirable 🚫 behaviors \[[00:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=0)].  
* 🏄 Urges are viewed metaphorically as 🌊 waves: they 📈 rise, reach a ⛰️ peak of maximum intensity, and then 📉 naturally fall and fade away \[[01:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=93)].  
* The 🔁 cycle starts with an 💥 activating event (a trigger) followed by the 📈 rise, ⛰️ peak, and 📉 fall of the urge \[[02:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=160)].  
* Engaging 🚫 in the undesirable behavior (e.g., 🚬 smoking, 🍕 overeating, 💭 OCD compulsion) provides 😌 short-term relief by stopping the urge from rising but 🧠 teaches the mind to take a shortcut, leading to earlier behavior engagement \[[03:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=187)].  
* The 🎯 goal is to learn to 🏄 ride the entire wave, allowing the urge to build, peak, and fall naturally without acting on the underlying 💡 desire \[[03:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=234)].  
* The 📝 practice exercise uses a piece of 🍎 food placed on the tongue to train the skill by observing the urge to 💧 swallow rise, peak, and fall \[[05:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=338)].  
* During 💯 peak intensity, count to 10 before making a decision to swallow, avoiding 🚫 distraction and remaining mindful of the urge's presence \[[06:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=400)].  
* Use 🧘 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) skills, such as 💬 *thanking your mind* for its warnings or ⚓ *dropping anchor*, to manage distracting thoughts (e.g., *I'm going to drown*, *This is too hard*) \[[07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=440)].  
* Maintain 🌳 grounding by focusing on a physical sensation like the 🌬️ breath or the 🦶 feet on the floor to remain present throughout the 🔑 exercise \[[08:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=495)].  
* Notice that you still have control of your 🧍 body's actions (e.g., moving arms or standing) even while the intense urge is 💡 present \[[13:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=821)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
💡 Urge Surfing, a skill derived from 🧘 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), focuses on 💯 acceptance of the urge as a temporary, intense physical state \[[04:03](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=243)]. This 🔄 contrasts sharply with traditional [[../topics/cognitive-behavioral-therapy|♻️🫀🧠💪 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy]] (CBT) approaches, which often encourage 🗣️ directly challenging or restructuring the maladaptive thoughts that generate the craving [Source: *Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Substance Use Disorders* by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)]. ACT’s 🔑 benefit is teaching an individual the ability to tolerate 😬 intense discomfort while maintaining mindful control over their 🧭 actions \[[13:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=821)].  
  
* 🔎 **Topics to Explore for Better Understanding**  
    * 🧭 **Values Clarification:** Explore how Urge Surfing's effectiveness is often predicated on the individual's prior clarification of their core 💡 values, which provides the necessary *motivation* to tolerate the urge wave [Source: *Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: The Process and Practice of Mindful Living* by Steven C. Hayes].  
    * ⚠️ **Dissociation Management:** Investigate the specific 🛠️ tools and prerequisites required for individuals who experience 🤯 dissociation during intense emotional or physical states to ensure the grounding techniques are sufficient for them to safely engage with the 🌊 exercise \[[08:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=495)].  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 🌊 Q: What is urge surfing and how does this skill help manage powerful cravings or desires?  
🏄 A: Urge 🏄 surfing is a psychological skill that helps you manage powerful cravings or desires by viewing them as temporary, naturally 🌊 occurring phenomena. Like an ocean wave, an urge will naturally 📈 rise, ⛰️ peak, and then 📉 fall away without any intervention. The skill trains you to ⏳ wait for the urge to pass without acting on it, demonstrating that you can tolerate the peak discomfort \[[01:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=93)].  
  
### 💡 Q: Where does the concept of urge surfing originate, and for which conditions is it commonly used?  
🧘 A: The 💡 technique is a core skill utilized in 🧭 Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). It is a highly 🎯 versatile tool applicable to managing cravings related to 🚬 substance misuse, 🍕 emotional eating, 💰 compulsive spending, and the intense desires for 💭 compulsions experienced with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) \[[01:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=64)].  
  
### 🔑 Q: How does practicing the skill of urge surfing change my behavior over time?  
🧠 A: By repeatedly experiencing the 🌊 wave of an urge without giving in, the mind learns that the 😬 discomfort is temporary and tolerable, and that the urge does 🚫 not require an immediate behavioral response \[[03:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=234)]. This process breaks the conditioned 🔁 cycle where the mind takes a shortcut from a trigger directly to the undesirable 🎯 behavior, eventually providing greater 💯 control over your actions \[[03:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASG1c1EqXyc&t=221)].
