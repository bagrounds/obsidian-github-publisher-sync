### 📖 Summary  
  
*The Sleep Solution* 💡 offers a comprehensive guide to understanding and improving sleep, written by neurologist and sleep specialist Dr. W. Chris Winter. 📖 The book aims to demystify sleep science, debunk common myths, and provide practical, evidence-based strategies for overcoming sleep problems like insomnia. 👨‍⚕️ Dr. Winter challenges readers to change their mindset about sleep, emphasizing that many sleep issues stem from anxiety and misconceptions rather than an actual inability to sleep. ⏰ He covers topics such as circadian rhythms, sleep stages, sleep hygiene, napping, sleep disorders (insomnia, apnea), sleep medications, and the role of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).
