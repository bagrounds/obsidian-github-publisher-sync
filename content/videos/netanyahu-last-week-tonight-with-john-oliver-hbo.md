* 🤝 Aligned with **extreme voices** in the country to remain in power, relying heavily on ultra-Orthodox religious parties and far-right ultranationalists \[[18:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=1085)].  
* 🚨 Appointed **Ben Gvir** as National Security Minister, a hardline believer in the settler movement and a man once convicted of supporting a terrorist organization and incitement to racism \[[18:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=1097)].  
* 💰 Deliberately allowed **Qatar to funnel money into Gaza** to keep Hamas in power, which lessened pressure to negotiate toward a Palestinian state with the more moderate Palestinian Authority \[[23:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=1422)].

## 🤔 Evaluation  
* 🗣️ The video presents a **singular, forceful critique** of Prime Minister Netanyahu, attributing much of the current crisis and its specific nature to his personal ambition and political decisions \[[32:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=1940)].  
* 🛡️ A **contrasting perspective**, often cited by his supporters and other political analysts, views him as the **indispensable "Mr. Security"** who understands the region's threats better than any rival, prioritizing Israel's defense and stability above all else \[[01:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=103)].  
* 🌍 His proponents would argue that the **Abraham Accords** were a historic, pragmatic triumph that created regional alliances and normalized relations without waiting for Palestinian consensus, which they view as an indefinite political hurdle \[[09:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=594)].

    * 🤝 The specific, long-term **geopolitical and economic ramifications** of the Abraham Accords on regional stability and the future of Palestinian statehood \[[10:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=620)].  
    * 🇺🇸 The historical context and extent of **U.S. military and diplomatic aid** to Israel and how this support is currently debated and justified in U.S. foreign policy \[[05:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Bwix9IjOE&t=322)].
