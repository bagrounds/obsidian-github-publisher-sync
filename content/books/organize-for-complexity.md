## Notes  
> If you want to truly understand something, try to change it.  
  
Kurt Lewin  
  
- Taylorism separated organizations into thinking managers and non-thinking human resources  
  - it worked for a while, but not anymore  
  - 3 gaps  
    - social: management by numbers & leadership by fear  
    - functional: narrow, fragmented responsibilities need coordination & hierarchy  
    - time: thinkers need to forecast and plan for doers  
  - the whole system is inhumane and wasteful  
- complicated vs complex  
  - complicated systems are standardized, precise, and predictable  
  - complex systems are observable but not predictable or controllable  
  
> To treat complex organizations as complicated systems is a fundamental thinking mistake, an over-simplification.  
  
> Systems are not improved by tinkering with the parts, but by working on their interactions  
  
- symptoms vs problems  
  - we see the symptoms of problems  
  - 5 why's helps identify root causes  
  
> The attempt to find solutions for symptoms alone, or to tinker with symptoms before the problem has been understood, is called activism.  
  
Complex, intertwined problems are called messes.  
  
Clean up a small number of messes to fix many problems and alleviate many more symptoms.  
  
> Tools are unsuitable to deal with messes.  
  
> Activism breeds failure and makes learning impossible.  
  
People are intrinsically motivated.  
  
> The main thing that organizations can do to stimulate performance is facilitating options for connection between individuals and throughout the organization, through purpose and meaningful work.  
  
> In complexity, diversity in motivations and preferences can be an asset, or a liability, depending on the level of self-reflection present.
