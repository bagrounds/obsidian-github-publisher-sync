## 💬 Quartz Giscus Comments  
[Yesterday](./2024-11-23.md#🧑‍🚀%20Exploring%20Quartz%20Features), I noticed that Quartz has built-in support for Giscus comments. It made me wonder who implemented them first.  
- 🔬 According to [git history](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/commit/03f23e5054358dfbe0700904a35033858c40fa45#diff-a705c7f12f0ab8480a6fb0639c2ab8c7f6e788445f664feec0ff6a5c7ecfa63e), it looks like Quartz added Giscus comments about 4 months ago.  
- 🪞 It's usually a good idea to do some research before implementing a thing. Maybe someone else already has!  
- 🔜 I should probably update Quartz and use the built-in Gisgus comments.  
- 🐛 I have noticed that I have to reload the page before comments show up.
