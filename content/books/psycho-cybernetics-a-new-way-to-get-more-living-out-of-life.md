# 🧐🕹️🔁 Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life  
## 📚 Book Report: *Psycho-Cybernetics: A New Way to Get More Living Out of Life*  
  
### 💡 Overview  
* 🧑‍⚕️ **Author:** Maxwell Maltz.  
* 🗓️ **Publication Date:** 1960.  
* 👨‍⚕️ **Author Background:** Maltz was an American cosmetic surgeon who observed that changing a person's physical appearance didn't always change their underlying unhappiness or insecurity. This led him to explore the psychological impact of self-image.  
* 🎯 **Central Theme:** The book introduces the concept that our self-image acts as a mental blueprint or "target" that guides our actions and achievements. By understanding and modifying this self-image, individuals can achieve greater success and fulfillment. It applies principles of cybernetics—the study of goal-seeking mechanisms—to human psychology.  
  
### 🧠 Key Concepts  
* 👤 **Self-Image:** The cornerstone of personality and behavior. It's how we see ourselves, built from beliefs and past experiences, and it dictates the limits of what we can achieve. A realistic and adequate self-image is crucial for a satisfying life.  
* ⚙️ **Cybernetic Mechanism (Servo-Mechanism):** Maltz proposes the human brain and nervous system function like a goal-striving mechanism, similar to a guided missile 🚀 or thermostat 🌡️. This mechanism automatically works towards the "target" set by our dominant thoughts and self-image.  
* ✅ ❌ **The Success and Failure Mechanisms:** The subconscious mind acts as a "Creative Mechanism" that works automatically on the goals provided by the conscious mind, driven by the existing self-image. Worrying or focusing on negative outcomes feeds the failure mechanism, while focusing on positive goals engages the success mechanism.  
* 🧘 **Visualization and Mental Rehearsal:** The nervous system cannot distinguish between a real experience and a vividly imagined one. Therefore, mentally rehearsing success or desired outcomes can help reprogram the self-image and guide the cybernetic mechanism towards those goals.  
* 😌 **Relaxation and De-hypnosis:** Maltz emphasizes the need to relax and consciously challenge and discard negative, false beliefs about oneself ("dehypnotize") to allow the success mechanism to function effectively. Hypnosis, in this context, is the relaxed acceptance of ideas.  
* 😃 **Happiness as a Habit:** Happiness is presented not just as a result of success, but as a state of mind and a habit that can be cultivated by consciously choosing positive thoughts and focusing on goals.  
  
### 🎯👤 & 🚀 Impact  
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Audience:** Individuals seeking self-improvement, goal achievement, and a better understanding of the mind-body connection.  
* 💥 **Impact:** *Psycho-Cybernetics* is considered a foundational work in the self-help genre, influencing many subsequent authors and speakers like Tony Robbins, Zig Ziglar, and Brian Tracy. Its principles have also been applied in areas like sports psychology 🏀 and athlete training 🏋️. It helped popularize concepts like visualization and the importance of self-image in personal development. The book has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. 🌎

* 🌱 ***[Mindset](./mindset.md): The New Psychology of Success*** **by Carol S. Dweck:** Focuses on the difference between a "fixed" and "growth" mindset, which resonates with Maltz's idea of changing limiting beliefs (self-image) to unlock potential.

* 😔 ***Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*** **by David D.
