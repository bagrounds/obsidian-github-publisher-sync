* 🎯 **Targeting "Criminals" and "Homegrowns"**: 🗣️ Trump's focus extends beyond undocumented migrants convicted of crimes (who make up only about 8% of those ICE apprehends) to include what he calls "homegrowns"—🇺🇸 U.S. citizens he claims are criminals 🧑‍⚖️ \[[02:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxG6O127EQQ&t=150)\]. ⚠️ The speaker notes that Trump has previously defined former administration officials who spoke out against him as potential traitors \[[03:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxG6O127EQQ&t=189)\].
