# Expecting Better  
_Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong - and What You Really Need to Know_  
  
- Written by Emily Oster  
  - An economics professor  
  - Who was frustrated by opaque rules given to pregnant women by doctors  
  - and prefers to take a decision theory approach  
    - look at the data  
    - consider pros & cons relevant to you  
    - make a decision  
- During pregnancy  
  - women are given lists of behavioral rules  
    - that often differ by provider  
    - and are rarely explained or supported with evidence  
  - and there are many norms, myths, and misunderstandings in popular culture that tend to steer the behavior of pregnant women, whether justified or not  
- The author dives into the scientific research backing many of these rules in order to provide a more nuanced understanding of risk
