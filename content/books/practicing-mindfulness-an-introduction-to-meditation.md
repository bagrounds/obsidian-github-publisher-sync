## 📝🐒 Human Notes  
- 🧘 Practicing mindfulness is like 🐕‍🦺 training a puppy.  
    - 🐾 You put the puppy down and tell it to stay.  
    - 🤔 The puppy wonders away.  
    - ↩️ So you pick the puppy up again and put it down again and tell it to stay.  
    - 🚶 And it wonders away again.  
    - 😠 It does no good to treat the puppy harshly.  
    - 🔄 You do it over and over until one day, ✨ voila, the puppy stays.  
    - 🌬️ Likewise, firmly, but kindly returning the awareness to the breath 🧠 sharpens your attentiveness to what the mind is doing and accustoms it to staying put.  
- ✌️ There are two ways to do the dishes 🍽️
