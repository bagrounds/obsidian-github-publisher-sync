# [🗣️🗺️🤖⚙️ Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14992)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
This paper outlines a new framework, Reasoning via Planning (RAP). It argues that [🤖🦜 Large Language Models (LLMs)](../topics/large-language-models.md) sometimes 🤯 struggle with problems that are easy for humans, such as generating action plans, complex math, or logical reasoning.  
  
* This 😢 deficiency stems from the fact that LLMs lack an internal world model to predict the world state and simulate long-term outcomes.  
* The 💡 solution proposed is a new LLM reasoning framework called Reasoning via Planning (RAP).  
* RAP repurposes the 🤖 LLM as both a world model and a reasoning agent.  
* The framework incorporates a principled planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search for 🗺️ strategic exploration of the reasoning space.  
* The paper 📈 demonstrates RAP's superiority over strong baselines on challenging reasoning problems, including plan generation, math reasoning, and logical inference.  
* In one plan generation setting, RAP with LLaMA-33B even 👑 surpasses CoT with GPT-4, achieving a 33% relative improvement.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
The paper 🧐 contrasts the new framework with existing methods, primarily Chain-of-Thought (CoT), arguing that current LLM reasoning is "instinctively" autoregressive, which is in stark contrast to the deliberate planning enabled by RAP. RAP's approach formally introduces a world model, reward mechanisms, and state into a unified framework, which the authors claim other search-guided methods lack. For further understanding, the paper suggests a few areas to explore. It would be interesting to see how 🛠️ fine-tuning LLMs could enhance their reasoning and world model capabilities. Additionally, combining RAP with 🤝 external tools is an identified path for solving more complex real-world problems. The paper also highlights that the combination of multiple rewards improves performance, but the specific effects depend on the nature of the task.
