# 💻🔄💻 Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again)  
![Andrej Karpathy: Software Is Changing (Again)](https://youtu.be/LCEmiRjPEtQ)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* ⚙️ **Evolution of Software**:  
    * 👨‍💻 **Software 1.0:** ⌨️ Traditional code written by humans \[[01:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=102)\].  
    * 🧠 **Software 2.0:** 🕸️ Neural networks, where the code is learned through data and optimization \[[01:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=108)\].  
    * 🗣️ **Software 3.0:** [🤖🦜 Large Language Models (LLMs)](../topics/large-language-models.md) that are programmable using natural language prompts \[[03:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=186)\].  
* 🏢 **LLMs as New Operating Systems**:  
    * 💡 LLMs are likened to utilities due to centralized training (capex) and metered access via APIs (opex) \[[06:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=395)\].  
    * 🏭 LLMs are analogous to fabs due to significant capital investment and rapid technological advancements \[[08:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=484)\].  
    * 💻 LLMs are presented as analogous to operating systems, with closed-source providers and open-source alternatives \[[09:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=547)\].  
    * 🕰️ The current state of LLM computing is akin to the 1960s era of centralized, time-shared computers \[[11:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=662)\].  
    * 🔄 LLMs exhibit "flipped" technology diffusion, with consumers often being the first adopters \[[12:57](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=777)\].  
* 🧠 **Psychology of LLMs**:  
    * 🎭 LLMs are described as "stochastic simulations of people" with emergent human-like psychology \[[14:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=889)\].  
    * 📚 They possess encyclopedic knowledge and memory \[[15:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=930)\].  
    * 🤕 They have cognitive deficits such as hallucination, jagged intelligence, and anterograde amnesia \[[16:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=967)\].  
    * 🔒 Security limitations like gullibility and susceptibility to prompt injection are noted \[[17:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1058)\].  
* 🚀 **Opportunities and Applications**:  
    * 🤖 **Partial Autonomy Apps:** 🖱️ Examples include Cursor and Perplexity \[[18:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1105)\]. ⚙️ These apps feature extensive context management by LLMs \[[19:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1164)\], 🔗 orchestration of multiple LLM calls \[[19:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1172)\], 🎨 application-specific GUIs for auditing and faster human interaction \[[19:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1184)\], and an "autonomy slider" \[[20:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1226)\].  
    * 🤝 **Human-AI Collaboration:** ⚡ The goal is to make the generation-verification loop as fast as possible \[[22:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1339)\]. 🎨 GUIs are crucial for quick visual auditing, and it's important to "keep the AI on the leash" \[[22:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1373)\].  
    * ✨ **Vibe Coding:** ⌨️ The ability to "program" using natural language makes everyone a potential programmer \[[29:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=1751)\].  
    * 🏗️ **Building for Agents:** 🧱 Advocates for designing software infrastructure directly accessible and understandable by LLM agents, such as using `lm.txt` files for domain descriptions or providing documentation in LLM-friendly formats like Markdown \[[33:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=2013)\]. 👉 Suggests replacing "click" instructions with equivalent API commands for agents \[[35:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=2155)\].  
* 🔮 **Future Outlook:** ⏳ The industry is in an exciting, early stage, akin to the 1960s of operating systems \[[38:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=2296)\]. 📈 The next decade will see a gradual shift towards more autonomous products \[[39:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ&t=2348)\].
