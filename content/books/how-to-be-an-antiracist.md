### 🏆 Ibram X. Kendi's Antiracist Strategy  
  
#### 💡 Core Philosophy  
* 🚫 No Neutrality: No "not racist" stance; one is either racist or actively antiracist.  
* 📝 Racism Defined: A collection of racist policies and racist ideas producing and normalizing racial inequities.  
* 🏛️ Policy-Driven: Racist policies create racist ideas, not the reverse.  
* ⚖️ Inherent Equality: All racial groups are inherently equal in all their differences.  
* 💪 Power Focus: Racism is a power construct. Fighting it requires power, not just knowledge.  
  
#### 🔑 Key Definitions  
* ✊ Antiracist: Supports an antiracist policy via actions or expresses an antiracist idea.  
* 👎 Racist: Supports a racist policy via actions/inactions or expresses a racist idea.  
* ✅ Antiracist Policy: Any measure producing or sustaining racial equity between racial groups.  
* ❌ Racist Policy: Any measure producing or sustaining racial inequity between racial groups.  
* 🤝 Antiracist Idea: Idea that racial groups are equal in all differences; no superiority/inferiority.  
* 😠 Racist Idea: Idea that one racial group is inferior or superior to another.  
* 🎭 Racial Inequity: Different racial groups do not share approximately equal footing/power/opportunities.  
* 🎭 Dueling Consciousness: Internal conflict between antiracist and racist ideas within individuals.  
  
#### 🔎 Identifying Racist Expressions  
* 👓 Reject Colorblindness: Denying racial categories prevents identifying and challenging inequity.  
* 🗣️ Beyond Microaggressions: "Microaggressions" are persistent, daily racist abuse, not minor.  
* ➡️ Forms of Racism:  
    * 🧬 Biological: Belief in inherent, hierarchical biological racial differences.  
    * 🤝 Assimilationist: Belief in cultural/behavioral inferiority of a group, advocating "development" programs.  
    * 🏘️ Segregationist: Belief in permanent inferiority, advocating segregation, enslavement, or elimination.  
    * 🎨 Colorism: Policies leading to inequities between light and dark-skinned people.  
    * 💰 Class Racism (Racial Capitalism): Intertwining of racist policies with capitalism, oppressing poor people of color.  
    * 🌍 Space Racism: Policies causing resource inequity or elimination of racialized spaces.  
* 🌐 Universal Capacity: Anyone, regardless of race, can express racist ideas or support racist policies.  
  
#### 👣 Becoming Antiracist: Action Steps  
* 🤔 Self-Reflection:  
    * 🧘 Practice continuous self-awareness, self-criticism, and self-examination.  
    * 🙏 Admit and confess supported racist policies and expressed racist ideas.  
* 🏛️ Policy Focus:  
    * 🎯 Shift focus from "bad people" to "bad policy" as the cause of inequity.  
    * ✅ Actively support antiracist policies; this is the primary practice of antiracism.  
    * 🎯 Identify specific racial inequities and their underlying racist policies.  
    * 🕵️ Investigate, uncover, and expose racist policies.  
    * 💡 Invent or find effective antiracist policy solutions.  
    * 🤝 Work with policymakers to institute antiracist policies.  
* 📣 Challenging Ideas:  
    * 📢 Disseminate and educate others about racist policies and antiracist correctives.  
    * 👤 Individualize behavior; do not generalize individual actions to entire racial groups.  
    * 🚫 Actively challenge racial stereotypes.  
    * ✊🏾 Oppose racist remarks and actions actively.  
* ➕ Intersectionality: Recognize how racism intersects with class, gender, sexuality, and other identities.  
* 🔄 Ongoing Journey: Antiracism is a continuous, evolving process, not a fixed state.
