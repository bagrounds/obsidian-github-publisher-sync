## 🤖 Product Report: iRobot Roomba Plus 505 Combo  
  
### 🧹 Core Cleaning Technology  
  
* ⚙️ **Dual Functionality:** Offers both powerful vacuuming and active mopping. 💨 Cleaning modes include vacuum-only, mop-only, vacuum then mop, or combination simultaneous cleaning.  
* 💪 **Suction Power:** Provides strong, power-lifting suction, reportedly up to 70x stronger than older Roomba 600 series models, which automatically increases on carpeted areas (CarpetBoost). ⬆️  
* 🧽 **Mopping System:** Utilizes DualClean Spinning Mop Pads that extend outward, known as PerfectEdge technology, to reach corners and along walls, improving edge-to-edge coverage by an estimated 18%. 📐  
* ✨ **SmartScrub:** Applies increased downward pressure and scrubbing motion for tackling tougher, dried-on messes.  
* ↔️ **Multi-Surface Cleaning:** Features dual multi-surface rubber brushes for effective debris extraction and an auto pad lift mechanism to raise the mop pads (up to 10mm) when transitioning onto carpeted floors, preventing dampening. ↕️  
  
### 🧭 Navigation and Intelligence  
  
* 🗺️ **LiDAR Mapping (ClearView Pro LiDAR):** Employs LiDAR technology for expert, real-time mapping of the home, allowing for efficient, systematic cleaning in neat rows and comprehensive coverage day or night. 🌃  
* ⚠️ **Obstacle Avoidance (PrecisionVision AI):** Uses artificial intelligence and specialized sensors to immediately recognize and intelligently navigate around common household hazards, including cords, socks, shoes, and pet waste. 💩  
* 🎯 **Dirt Detection:** The robot prioritizes areas that are identified as getting dirty fastest, allowing it to adapt its cleaning settings and intensity for a deeper clean where needed.  
* 📱 **Smart Home Integration:** The system is compatible with Matter smart home capabilities, allowing voice control integration with devices like Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. 🗣️  
  
### 🧼 AutoWash Dock Features  
  
The AutoWash Dock is the defining feature, providing a hands-off, closed-loop cleaning cycle for both the robot and the mop pads.  
  
* 🗑️ **Self-Emptying:** Automatically transfers collected dust and debris from the robot's bin into a disposable bag housed in the dock, offering up to 75 days of maintenance-free vacuum emptying.  
* 💧 **Pad Washing and Drying:** The robot returns to the dock to wash its mop pads mid-mission and upon completion. ⛲ The dock contains clean and dirty water tanks, and uses a continuous cycle to refresh and clean the pads.  
* 🔥 **Heated Drying:** After washing, the dock utilizes heated air to thoroughly dry the mop pads, preventing mildew, odors, and bacterial growth.  
* ♻️ **Self-Cleaning:** The dock is designed with self-cleaning cycles to maintain its own wash basin and components.
