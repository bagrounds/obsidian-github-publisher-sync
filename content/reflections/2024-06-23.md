## Scheduling Interviews  
I have a pretty good interview preparation and practice routine in place.  
But I don't currently have any interviews scheduled.   
How should I _get_ more interviews?  
1. **Recruiters contact me** via, e.g. LinkedIn  
    1. This makes my job very easy  
    2. For my prior interview, this is what happened  
    3. But there are a few issues with this  
        1. Lack of control. If nobody reaches out, and my queue is empty, I'm out of luck.  
2. Apply to job postings  
    1. It's been a while since I've directly applied.  
    2. Do they actually respond to applications?  
    3. It does seem like a very direct way to proactively seek a job.  
3. Query my network   
    1. Friends and past colleagues could be hiring, know someone who is, or even just put in a referral at their company.  
    2. I believe networking is where most jobs come from ... Or I've read things to this effect.
