# 🏃🤸🧠💪 Why You Should Train Movement, Not Muscle  
![Why You Should Train Movement, Not Muscle - with Jay Dicharry](https://youtu.be/qO9cilBI2c0)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
The video, a podcast with physical therapist Jay Dicharry, discusses his book, [🏃🛠️⚡ Running Rewired: Reinvent Your Run for Stability, Strength, and Speed](../books/running-rewired-reinvent-your-run-for-stability-strength-and-speed.md), and his philosophy on running mechanics. 🏃  
  
* Focus on **quality over quantity**: 💡 Do not simply increase mileage to improve; instead, focus on skill work.  
* Practice **deliberate practice**: 🤸‍♂️ Improve specific skills like mobility, stability, and strength, rather than just "specific practice," which is simply running more.  
* Train **movement patterns** over individual muscles: ⚙️ Concentrate on core control for dynamic stability, counter rotation through the feet, hips, and spine, and using hip muscles for propulsion instead of being quad-dominant.  
* **High injury rates** are a result of unprepared bodies: 🏥 Running places two and a half to three times a person’s body weight on the body with every stride, necessitating strength conditioning to prepare bones and ligaments.  
* **Cadence and foot strike** are not one-size-fits-all: 👣 A 180 strides-per-minute cadence is a myth; foot strike is less important than where the foot lands relative to the body.  
* **Rate of force development** is the "Holy Grail" of athletic performance: 💥 The speed at which a person can apply force to the ground is crucial for running economy and performance.  
* Shoes are just **tools**: 👟 No shoe can fix a runner's problems, and runners should use a variety of shoes to avoid dependency.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
Jay Dicharry's work in *Running Rewired* is widely praised by running coaches, physical therapists, and athletes for its **practical, science-based approach** to injury prevention and performance. 👏 His emphasis on **biomechanics, functional strength, and movement patterns** contrasts with traditional training philosophies that focus solely on mileage or speed work. 📚 Other perspectives in the running community, however, note that some of the exercises and tests in the book can be difficult to perform without a physical therapist's guidance or specific gym equipment, making it a significant time commitment. ⏳ While his methods are supported by research, the practical application may pose a challenge for the average runner with limited time or resources. To better understand this topic, one could explore the debate around minimalist footwear, alternative strength training programs for runners, and how to apply these concepts to specific running goals, such as marathon training. 🏞️
