* 📉 **The Death of the 'Tech Demigod':** The public image of the tech leader as a heroic innovator has been **shattered** 💥, symbolized by **Elon Musk's declining brand** 😠 (recently the most hated person in America) and the realization that extreme wealth can be "deleterious" to mental health, leading to megalomania and hubris.  
* ⚔️ **Misinformation as a Profit Model:** Tech companies are actively struggling with the overwhelming spread of **misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories** 👽.
