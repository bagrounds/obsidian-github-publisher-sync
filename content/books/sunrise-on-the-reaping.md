### 📚 Recommendations  
  
* **Non-Fiction:**  
    * ***The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II*** **by Iris Chang:** This harrowing historical account details the atrocities committed during the Nanking Massacre. **Justification:** *Sunrise on the Reaping*, like other *Hunger Games* novels, unflinchingly portrays the brutality of war and systematic oppression, and Chang's work provides a real-world parallel to the horrors of unchecked power and violence against a civilian population, reflecting the bleak realities that underpin dystopian fiction. 📜🇨🇳  
    * ***Propaganda*** **by Edward Bernays:** Written by one of the foundational figures in public relations and propaganda. **Justification:** A core theme in *Sunrise on the Reaping* is the Capitol's manipulation of narratives and use of propaganda to control the districts. Bernays' work offers a direct look into the theories and strategies behind influencing public opinion, providing a non-fiction lens on the tactics employed by Panem's regime. 📢🧠  
  
* **If You Loved This:**  
    * ***The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes*** **by Suzanne Collins:** If you haven't already, this earlier prequel focusing on a young Coriolanus Snow is a must-read. **Justification:** It delves into the formative years of another major antagonist and explores the early days of the Hunger Games, providing crucial context and a similar tone and thematic depth to *Sunrise on the Reaping*. 🐦🐍  
    * ***Scythe (Arc of a Scythe, #1)*** **by Neal Shusterman:** In a world where humanity has conquered death, Scythes are the only ones who can randomly "glean" (kill) to control the population. **Justification:** This series shares the young adult dystopian genre, high stakes, and profound moral and ethical questions about life, death, and societal control, much like the life-or-death decisions and oppressive systems explored in *Sunrise on the Reaping*. 💀🌍  
  
* **Similar But Different:**  
    * **[☄️🧑‍🚀🙏🌍 Project Hail Mary](./project-hail-mary.md)** **by Andy Weir:** A lone astronaut wakes up with amnesia on a mission to save humanity, armed only with science and his wits. **Justification:** While this is science fiction rather than dystopian, it features a protagonist facing overwhelming odds and a seemingly impossible task, relying on intelligence and resilience to survive and find solutions, echoing the strategic thinking and survival aspects within the deadly arena of the Hunger Games, but in a vastly different setting and with a more hopeful, problem-solving tone. 🚀🌌  
    * ***The Poppy War*** **by R.F. Kuang:** A dark fantasy novel inspired by mid-20th-century Chinese history, following a war orphan who aces an empire-wide test and gains access to a prestigious military academy, only to discover her shamanic powers and the brutal realities of war. **Justification:** This book shares the themes of a brutal training/competition environment, the horrors of war, and a protagonist grappling with immense power and trauma, similar to Haymitch's journey. However, it's set in a fantasy world with magic, offering a different flavor of grim reality and intense conflict. 🔥🐉
