## 📖 Book Report: 🇵🇸 The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017  
  
### 📝 Synopsis  
  
📖 Rashid Khalidi's 🇵🇸 The Hundred Years' War on Palestine: A History of Settler Colonialism and Resistance, 1917–2017 presents a comprehensive reinterpretation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, framing it not as a symmetrical clash between two national movements, but as a century-long colonial war waged against the indigenous Palestinian population. 🗓️ The book spans from the Balfour Declaration in 1917 to 2017, examining pivotal episodes that Khalidi characterizes as "declarations of war" on the Palestinian people. 📜 These include the British Mandate, the 💔 1948 Nakba, the ⚔️ 1967 Six-Day War, 🪖 Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, the 🤝 Oslo Accords, and subsequent assaults on Gaza.  
  
### 🔑 Key Themes  
  
* 🏘️ **Settler Colonialism:** 🔑 A central argument of the book is that Zionism and the subsequent actions of Israel constitute a settler colonial project, akin to those seen in other parts of the non-European world. 🌍 This framework emphasizes the aim to replace the indigenous population and control their land.  
* ✊ **Resistance:** 🗣️ Khalidi highlights the continuous, though often fragmented and under-resourced, Palestinian resistance against this colonial endeavor. 💪 He details various forms of Palestinian agency despite overwhelming odds.  
* 🌍 **External Power Involvement:** 📜 The book meticulously documents the crucial role of external powers, particularly 🇬🇧 Great Britain and 🇺🇸 the United States, in facilitating and sustaining the colonial project. 🏛️ These powers provided political, diplomatic, economic, and military backing.  
* 🗣️ **Narrative Control:** 🗣️ Khalidi addresses how dominant narratives, especially in the West, have obscured the colonial nature of the conflict, often portraying it as a tragic clash of equal claims or a security struggle. ✍️ He seeks to counter this by presenting an explicitly Palestinian perspective.  
* ⌛ **Fragmented History:** 📚 The book structures the century of conflict through six distinct "declarations of war," underscoring how discrete historical moments represent sustained attacks on Palestinian existence and national aspirations.  
  
### ✍️ Author's Approach and Argument  
  
👨‍🏫 Rashid Khalidi, the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies at Columbia University, draws on a wealth of scholarly research, 📁 untapped archival materials, and, uniquely, his own family's history. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 His family members, including mayors, judges, scholars, diplomats, and journalists, were witnesses to and participants in many key events, providing a deeply personal and interwoven narrative. 🙅‍♂️ Khalidi explicitly rejects the common interpretation that the conflict is simply a clash between two equal national movements. 🎯 Instead, his central thesis is that it has always been a colonial war waged against an indigenous population to force them to relinquish their homeland. 👴 He traces this perspective back to early Zionist leaders, arguing that they often dismissed the existence or rights of the indigenous Palestinians. ⚠️ While critical of Zionist and Israeli policies and the role of international powers, Khalidi also critically examines the failings, divisions, and political short-sightedness of various Palestinian leaders and organizations.  
  
### ✨ Impact and Significance  
  
🌟 The Hundred Years' War on Palestine is a seminal work that offers an essential Palestinian perspective on a highly contested history. ⚔️ It challenges widely accepted narratives, particularly those prevalent in Western discourse, by providing a rigorous historical account through the lens of settler colonialism. 👓 By reframing the conflict, Khalidi provides a powerful analytical framework for understanding its origins, evolution, and enduring nature. 💯 The book's significance lies in its comprehensive historical sweep, its use of diverse sources including personal family archives, and its unapologetic presentation of the Palestinian experience of dispossession and ongoing resistance. 🌍 It contributes significantly to academic and public understanding, aiming to shift perceptions and stimulate a more nuanced discussion about justice and peace in the region.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
  
### 🤝 Similar Books  
  
* 💔 The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine by Ilan Pappe offers a detailed historical account of the events of 1948, arguing that the displacement of Palestinians was a deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing. 🎯 It aligns with Khalidi's focus on the systematic nature of Palestinian dispossession.  
* 🌍 Orientalism by Edward Said - 👨‍🏫 Given Khalidi's position as the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies, Said's foundational work on how the Western academic and political establishment constructs the "Orient" provides a crucial theoretical underpinning for understanding the discursive battles Khalidi describes regarding the Palestinian narrative.  
* 🗺️ A Line in the Sand: Britain, France and the Struggle for the Middle East, 1914–1922 by James Barr delves into the imperial decisions of Britain and France in the aftermath of World War I, including the Balfour Declaration and the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which directly set the stage for the colonial dynamics Khalidi analyzes.  
  
### ⚔️ Contrasting Books  
  
* 📖 O Jerusalem! by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre is a Narrative history focusing on the events leading up to and during the 1948 war, providing a perspective that often emphasizes the Israeli struggle for survival and nation-building, without necessarily adopting Khalidi's settler colonial framework.  
* 🇮🇱 My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel by Ari Shavit offers a complex, often introspective, history of Israel from a Zionist perspective. 😔 It acknowledges the tragedy for Palestinians but frames it within the context of Jewish history and the imperative of creating a Jewish state, offering a contrasting interpretation of the conflict's moral and historical underpinnings.  
* 🛡️ The Case for Israel by Alan Dershowitz presents a staunch defense of Israel's policies and actions, arguing for the legitimacy of its existence and its defensive wars. ⚔️ It directly counters many of the criticisms and historical interpretations put forth by Khalidi.

* ⚖️ Dispossession: The Performative in the Political by Judith Butler explores themes of dispossession, resistance, and the political significance of public assembly and protest. Its theoretical insights can be applied to understanding the ongoing Palestinian struggle for recognition and rights in the face of political erasure.
