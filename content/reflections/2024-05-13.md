## 🐛 A Terminal Error  
I recently started seeing the following error when trying to open the Linux terminal on my Chromebook:  
`Launching vmshell failed: Error starting crostini for terminal: 62 (NEED_UPDATE)`  
A Google search for this exact error message turned up a [Reddit thread recommending a reboot](https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/comments/110znl1/error_starting_crostini_for_terminal_62_need).  
And indeed, a reboot fixed the problem.  
  
## 🏋🏻 Practice  
I've been playing a lot of [codingame](../software/codingame.md) lately to practice for interviews.  
Clash of Code is a multiplayer feature that presents small programming problems for up to 8 people to compete to solve.  
The problems are supposed to be solvable in about 5 minutes and each problem comes with a time limit of 15 minutes.  
This makes for great practice, as some employers expect candidates to solve problems in about 15 minutes a piece during interviews.  
Recently I came across a particularly challenging problem in Clash of Code that I couldn't solve during the 15 minute time limit.  
The problem was a variant of the [Change-making problem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem), which is a special case of the [Knapsack problem](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).  
These problems are _famously hard_ and can be solved with a technique called [Dynamic programming](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming).  
It's been a while since I've practice this technique, so I decided to brush up.  
I created a new [interview-prep](https://gitlab.com/bagrounds/interview-prep) git repository and wrote up solutions to a couple of these problems.
