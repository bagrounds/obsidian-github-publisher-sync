🍬 Saccharine doesn't cause cancer in humans.  
💊 In the US, supplements aren't regulated, don't have to do what they claim, often don't contain what they claim, and can be dangerous.  
💎 Crystals don't have energetic powers. The placebo effect can be strong.  
🍽️ Fasting can be harmful to cancer patients.
