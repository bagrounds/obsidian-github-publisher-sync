# Rapport  
- Rapport can be learned. Practice.  
- Depth of relationships > number.  
- We don't have to agree or like others, but we should always seek to understand them.  
- Make an effort to connect with others.  
- Build intimacy with those closest to you: children, parents, grandparents, close friends, and coworkers.  
- Do not deceive others. Trust is hard to recover.  
- Using force to control behavior is often ineffective and damages relationships.  
  - Don't try to force people to change.  
  - Help them solve their own problems by listening and reflecting.  
  - No one respects a bully; they only fear them.  
- Be direct and clear with the message. Avoid passive communication, email, and text for important messages. Practice directness until it's comfortable.  
- Control your emotions enough so that the message can be heard.  
  - Slow your reaction down by counting to ten or taking time to think.  
  - Stay focused on the goal. Resolve the issue.  
- Empathy: be more self aware. Empathy isn't a competition.  
  - Try seeing things from other's perspective whenever possible.  
  - Interpret others' situations based on their own perspective.  
- Autonomy: maintain your own and respect it in others.  
  - Even when the stakes are high, aim to start by offering options.  
- Reflection is about listening carefully and then repeating or paraphrasing the part you want to focus on. It keeps conversations moving forward.  
  - Well meaning advice is often ineffective because it doesn't relate to personal motivations and context.  
  - Don't tell people how to solve their problems or offer advice.  
- People are the best experts on their own problems.  
  - Ask them about their situation and goals and help them identify their own solutions.  
- All things in moderation: aim for fluidity in conversation.   
- Learning starts with self awareness.  
  - Identify your own animal archetypical behaviors.  
- Consider power relations.  
  - Sometimes it's better to approach a lion as a mouse, rather than another lion. Which role aligns most naturally?
