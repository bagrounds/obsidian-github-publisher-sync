## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* ⚖️ Comparison: The Federal Trade Commission report on Surveillance Pricing (Federal Trade Commission, July 2024) mirrors these concerns, noting that opaque data collection allows firms to extract maximum consumer surplus.  
* 🏦 Contrast: Economists often argue that dynamic pricing improves efficiency by matching supply with demand, as noted in The Economics of Dynamic Pricing (The Brookings Institution).  
* 🔍 Exploration: Further research into the legality of behavioral discrimination under the Robinson-Patman Act would clarify if these practices violate existing antitrust laws.
