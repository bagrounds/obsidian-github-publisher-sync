![A Brittle Administration Inventing a Crime Crisis | Explainer](https://youtu.be/iZ0lB-EOEDI)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* The current 🏛️ administration is enormously brittle, with its public actions being performative attempts to look as if they are in control \[[00:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=18)].  
* The president's physical and mental deterioration has worsened since the 1980s \[[01:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=97)] and since the 2016 campaign \[[01:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=116)].  
* The president is increasingly focused on 🏠 real estate projects, such as remodeling the White House, the Rose Garden, and discussing plans for the Kennedy Center \[[04:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=255)].  
* The administration is inventing a new issue that they hope he can get traction on, specifically a crime crisis \[[07:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=438)], as a way to boost low approval ratings \[[06:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=399)].  
* The president's inner circle is attempting to shore him up to put an authoritarianism in place \[[05:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=347)].  
* The administration's 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 actions are extraordinarily unpopular \[[14:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=851)] and people are pushing back against them \[[14:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ0lB-EOEDI&t=862)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
The perspective presented in the video is a highly critical one, focusing on a narrative of presidential decline and a calculated push toward authoritarianism. To understand this better, one could explore topics such as the specific policies implemented by the administration, the economic and social conditions of the time, and the historical context of presidential actions. It would also be valuable to investigate the sources of information and evidence used to support the claims made in the video, such as the president's public appearances and policy decisions.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
  
* [👑🚫📜2️⃣0️⃣ On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century](../books/on-tyranny.md) by Timothy Snyder: This 📖 book provides a historical guide to resisting authoritarianism.  
* The Authoritarian Personality by Theodor W. Adorno: This classic work explores the psychological roots of authoritarianism, offering a contrasting perspective on why people might be drawn to such a leader.  
* The American Presidency by Robert Dallek: A comprehensive historical account of the presidency, which could provide a broader context for evaluating the claims made in the video.
