# 🤥📢👨‍💼 Tony Schwartz: The Truth About Trump | Oxford Union Q&A  
![Tony Schwartz: The Truth About Trump | Oxford Union Q&A](https://youtu.be/qxF_CDDJ0YI)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
The video covers several issues raised by Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter of *The Art of the Deal*, about his work on the book and his impressions of Donald Trump.  
  
* ✒️ **Deciding** to write the book with Donald Trump was a decision driven by a need for financial 💰 security, which Schwartz now views as losing his moral compass \[[08:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=488)].  
* 🎭 **Described** as having a stunningly short attention span and an utter disregard for the truth \[[11:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=670), [14:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=857)].  
* ⚫️ **Portrayed** as a "black hole" constantly seeking external validation because of a lack of inner substance \[[18:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=1129)].  
* 🤥 **Coined** the term "truthful hyperbole" to make Trump's exaggerations seem charming and innocent \[[16:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=1006)].  
* 🧐 **Acknowledged** personal flaws, including a sense of inadequacy and a hunger for validation, as reasons for working on the book \[[22:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=1352)].  
* 😡 **Believes** that Trump's flaws disqualify him from being president and that the anger of disenfranchised voters fuels his support \[[33:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=2031), [36:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=2171)].  
* 🗳️ **Predicted** that Trump would not concede an election loss but would instead blame a "rigged" system \[[40:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=2453)].  
* 🤝 **Concludes** that Trump's campaign is not a contrived strategy but a reflection of the man himself \[[38:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=2314)].  
* 🫂 **Asserts** that Trump is a racist and a misogynist, with a transactional view of people \[[46:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxF_CDDJ0YI&t=2791)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
This 🗣️ perspective is that of an insider who now has a strong ⚖️ critical view of his former associate. A contrasting perspective would be from those who believe Trump's use of "hyperbole" is a form of political rhetoric, not a disregard for the truth, and that his actions are a rejection of the political establishment. To get a better understanding of the issues discussed, one could explore topics such as the psychology of political leadership, the impact of ghostwriting on public perception, and the role of populist movements in modern politics.
