# [🔍🍎🌲📚 Information Foraging Theory](https://www.peterpirolli.com/ewExternalFiles/31354_C01_UNCORRECTED_PROOF.pdf)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* 🎯 Information foraging theory aims to explain and predict how people will best shape themselves for their information environments and how those environments can best be shaped for people.  
* 💡 The theory is guided by three maxims from Allen Newell's program of Unified Theories of Cognition: 1. 📢 Good science responds to real problems. 2. 🛠️ Good science makes a difference, providing the basis for new technology designs. 3. 🔍 Good science is in the details, aiming to produce working formal models for the analysis and prediction of observable behavior.  
* 🔬 The methodology of the theory is more akin to the methodology of **biology** than that of physics. This is due to its reliance on metaphors, models, and techniques from optimal foraging theory in biology.  
* 💸 The theory addresses the problem that a 💰 wealth of information creates a 😔 poverty of attention. The core design problem is to increase the ⏩ rate at which people can find and attend to information that is truly of value.  
* 📚 The theory also uses production system models to specify the mechanistic structures and processes that implement **bounded rationality**.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* **Comparison and Contrast:** This theory 🔄 contrasts with much of historical experimental psychology by adopting a methodology more like that of biology. It also provides a more complete explanation than purely mechanistic analyses of human-computer interaction (HCI). The theory draws upon work from behavioral ecology and microeconomics, as well as computational cognitive modeling.  
* **Topics to Explore:** An open question remains as to why humans have evolved such information collection strategies. Further exploration could delve into the "probabilistically textured information environment" which differs from the well-defined tasks that have been the dominant paradigms in HCI.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
* [🧭🍎 Foraging Theory](../books/foraging-theory.md). 🐦 This book provides the foundational biological concepts of optimal foraging theory that Information Foraging Theory draws upon.  
* The Architecture of Cognition. 🧠 A classic work that details the production systems and cognitive architecture that are extended in Information Foraging Theory.  
* The Adaptive Character of Thought. 🤔 This work provides the foundation for the rational analysis approach that is central to Information Foraging Theory.  
* The Economics of Information. 📈 A seminal paper that explores the economic concepts of information, which is a key influence on the theory.  
* Models of My Life. 🧩 An autobiography that discusses the concept of bounded rationality, a key idea contrasted with pure optimality in information foraging.
