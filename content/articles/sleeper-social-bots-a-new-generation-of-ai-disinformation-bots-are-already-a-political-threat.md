# [🤖😴📢🗳️ Sleeper Social Bots: A New Generation of AI Disinformation Bots are Already a Political Threat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12603)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
- 💡 Generative AI poses a _significant threat_ to future U.S. elections.  
  
- 📰 Political campaigns and individual bad actors can and will use generative AI to disinform, divide, and bewilder the voting public at a scale previously unseen.  
  
- 🤖 A new type of political social bot, the "sleeper social bot," has been introduced.  
  
- ✨ These new bots are designed to pass as humans on social platforms, where they are embedded like political "sleeper" agents, making them _harder to detect_ and more disruptive.  
  
- 🗣️ What sets new bots apart is their ability to engage in unrehearsed, _spontaneous dialogue_ with others, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to conduct conversations convincingly.  
  
- 🧠 Built around a Markov Decision Process and enhanced with chain-of-thought prompting, the bots could "think," post, reply, and _adapt their responses_ based on the flow of conversation.  
  
- 👨‍🎓 College students participating in initial experiments _failed to identify_ the bots, underscoring the urgent need for increased awareness.  
  
- 🔄 The bots successfully reframed falsehoods in convincing ways, defended their views in extended exchanges, and redirected off-topic discussions back to core disinformation themes.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
- ⚖️ The paper's concept of "sleeper social bots" highlights a _crucial evolution_ in computational propaganda: the shift from repetitive, uni-directional bots to sophisticated, LLM-powered conversational agents.  
  
- 📚 Earlier research, such as that by the Computational Propaganda Research Project at the Oxford Internet Institute, found that prior political bots primarily exerted influence by taking human-generated messaging and distributing it _strategically_ across networks.  
  
- 🎯 This new class of AI bot can now pass themselves off as authentic humans, befriend other users, and engage in _attuned dialogue_ over long periods to convert or radicalize a user's vote.  
  
- 🔍 The threat is rooted not just in automation but in the bots' ability to exhibit a _conversational and persuasive nature_.  
  
- 🛑 Prior generations of bots could often be identified by a quick scan of their posting history, which revealed a limited scope of content.  
  
- 🤖 Now, LLM-generated content allows new social bots to appear like the poster next door, making detection a _primary challenge_ for researchers who already face limitations like lack of data access and the "ground-truth problem," according to the Oxford Internet Institute.  
  
- 🔎 To explore for a better understanding, further research must focus on algorithmic _accountability and transparency_ from social media platforms, as highlighted by an analysis on computational propaganda techniques from the European Parliament.  
  
- 🛡️ An important topic to explore is identifying the _social characteristics_ of an electorate that makes it more resilient against opinion manipulation, such as having less polarized opinions and being more open to different viewpoints, as suggested by a mathematical model published in _PMC_.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### Q: 🤖 What are "sleeper social bots" and how do they differ from older election bots?  
  
A: 💤 Sleeper social bots are a _new generation_ of AI-driven accounts that use Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 Turbo to mimic human users with distinct personas, tones, and conversational styles. 🗣️ Unlike older bots that were repetitive, uni-directional, and mainly amplified human-generated messages, sleeper bots can engage in _spontaneous, unrehearsed dialogue_ and adapt their responses in real-time to persuade and manipulate human users over days or weeks. 🕵️ They are designed to be embedded in social platforms, passing as authentic users, which makes them _significantly harder to detect_.  
  
### Q: 🗳️ Is generative AI a real threat to the 2024 U.S. presidential election?  
  
A: ✅ Yes, generative AI is considered a _significant threat_ because it enables bad actors to produce fake images, video, and inordinate quantities of deceptive text, amplifying political un-truths at a scale previously unseen. 🚀 The combination of LLMs with social media allows for the rapid, convincing creation of bots that can sway public opinion, especially in a climate of _unparalleled division and mistrust_. 🚨 The paper's initial experiments show that college students _failed to identify_ these AI bots, confirming their high effectiveness as a tool for political disinformation.  
  
### Q: 🚧 What challenges do researchers face in detecting LLM-driven social bots?  
  
A: 🕵️ Identifying these advanced, LLM-driven bots is a _tedious and frustrating activity_ for researchers. 💻 The key limitations include the lack of _data access_ from social media platforms, the absence of standardized identification tools, and the "ground-truth problem" (knowing which accounts are _actually_ bots). 💡 While earlier bots had limited content history that gave them away, new AI-generated content allows bots to appear like a normal user, making detection systems need constant updating.
