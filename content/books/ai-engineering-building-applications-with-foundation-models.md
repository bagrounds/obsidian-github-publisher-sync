    - 1. 😵‍💫 Can't differentiate between data given and data generated  
        - 👨‍🔬 Ortega et. al  
        - 🤥 self delusion  
        - ❄️ snowballing hallucinations based on initial wrong assumptions  
        - 🛡️ mitigation  
            - 🏋️ reinforcement learning - differentiation about user provided prompts and tokens generated by model  
            - 👨‍🏫 supervised learning - include factual and counterfactual signals in training data  
    - 2. 🙅‍♂️ mismatch between model and labeler internal knowledge  
        - ❓ if labelers answer questions based on facts unknown by model, models learn to hallucinate  
        - 📝 if labelers state assumltions  
    - 🤔 John Schulman believes that models know when they know something  
        - ✅ verification - ask model to verify it's output  
            - 🗣️ prompt mitigations  
                - 💯 answer as truthfully as possible  
                - 🤷 say idk if you don't know  
                - ✍️ ask for concise responses  
        - 🏋️ reinforcement learning - punish hallucinations

## 📚 Book Report: AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models  
  
**AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models** by Chip Huyen 👨‍💻 serves as a comprehensive guide to the evolving field of AI engineering. ⚙️ It focuses on the practical application of large-scale, pre-trained models to build real-world applications. 🌍 The book is lauded for its systematic, end-to-end approach, guiding readers from the initial idea💡 to deployment and monitoring. 📊 A key theme is the shift from traditional machine learning, where models are often built from scratch, to a new paradigm that leverages the power of foundation models. 🚀 This makes AI application development more accessible and product-focused. 🎯  
  
### 🔑 Key Topics Discussed  
  
* 🧠 **Fundamentals of Foundation Models:** The book introduces core concepts like masked language models, autoregressive language models, and self-supervision. 🤖 It explains the architecture of these models and the parameters that differentiate them. 🧮 The importance of data quality and quantity for training these models is also a significant point of discussion. 📈  
* 📊 **Model Evaluation:** A substantial portion of the book is dedicated to evaluating different AI models. ⚖️ It presents various metrics and even explores using AI for the evaluation process itself, with the goal of selecting models based on objective criteria. ✅  
* 💻 **AI Implementation:** The text delves into practical implementation strategies. 👨‍💻 "Prompt engineering" is covered as a method to influence model output without altering the model itself. 🗣️ Other techniques discussed include few-shot learning and prompt decomposition. ✂️  
* ⚙️ **Fine-Tuning and Optimization:** For more specialized tasks, the book explains the process of "fine-tuning," which involves adjusting a model's internal parameters to enhance its performance on a specific job. 🎯 It also covers dataset engineering and inference optimization to improve the efficiency of AI systems. ⚡  
* 🏗️ **System Architecture:** The final chapters tie everything together by illustrating the architecture of an AI system. 🧩 Huyen explains how to integrate the various components and collect user feedback for continuous improvement. 👂  
  
### 🎯 Target Audience  
  
This book is primarily aimed at a technical audience, including AI engineers, software developers, and machine learning practitioners. 🧑‍💼 While the content can be challenging for those without a technical background, it provides immense value for professionals actively building AI applications. 🛠️ The emphasis on practical application and real-world use cases makes it a valuable resource for anyone looking to move from AI prototypes to production-ready systems. 🏭  
  
### 💡 Noteworthy Aspects  
  
A distinguishing feature of this book is its intentional lack of extensive code snippets. 🚫 The author, Chip Huyen, focuses on providing a lasting conceptual framework that transcends specific and rapidly evolving APIs and tools. 🛠️ This approach emphasizes a product-oriented mindset in AI engineering, a perspective often overlooked in more technically focused literature. 📚
