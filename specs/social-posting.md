# 📣 Social Posting — Three-Platform Social Media Pipeline

## 🎯 Overview

📋 Posts to Twitter, Bluesky, and Mastodon with platform-specific APIs and embed generation.
🧠 Implements five progressive text-fitting strategies to respect each platform's character limits.
🔗 Extracts OpenGraph metadata for rich link card embeds on Bluesky.
📝 Builds markdown embed sections for each platform to persist in Obsidian notes.

## 🔍 Content Discovery

📋 Content discovery uses a two-phase strategy to find notes that need social media posting.

### 🎯 Phase 1: Prior Day Reflection Priority

⏰ When the current time is past the posting hour (default 17:00 UTC / 9 AM PST), the system checks for yesterday's reflection.
✅ The prior day's reflection is posted if it has a creative title (not just the date) and has not yet been posted to all configured platforms.
🚫 If the reflection has an untitled (date-only) title, it is skipped.

### 🌐 Phase 2: BFS Content Discovery

🔍 When no prior day reflection is available (or it has already been posted), the system uses breadth-first search starting from the most recent reflection.
📊 BFS follows markdown links and Obsidian wiki links to discover linked content notes.
⏳ Reflections from date D are NOT eligible for posting until the posting hour on D+1. Non-reflection content is always eligible.
🚫 Index pages are never eligible for posting but are still traversed to discover linked content.
📋 At most one note is discovered per configured platform per run.
🔗 BFS always follows links from ALL visited nodes, including ineligible or non-postable content. 📄 This ensures that content reachable only through index pages, private notes, or stubs is still discoverable.

### 📏 Content Filters

🛡️ A note is postable only if it meets all of these criteria:
- 📄 Not an index page (filename is not `index.md`)
- 🏷️ Not flagged with `no_social: true` in frontmatter
- 📝 Not an untitled reflection (reflection whose title matches the date)
- 📐 Body content is at least 50 characters after stripping markup

### 🔗 URL Validation and Auto-Fix

🌐 Before posting, each candidate note's URL is verified with an HTTP HEAD request via `checkUrlPublished`.
✅ If the URL returns a 2xx status, the note proceeds to posting.
🔧 If the frontmatter URL returns a 404, the system derives the correct URL from the file path using `urlFromFilePath` (format: `https://bagrounds.org/{relative-path-without-.md}`).
🔄 If the file-path-derived URL differs from the frontmatter URL and is live, the frontmatter `URL` property is automatically updated via `updateFrontmatterUrl` and the corrected note proceeds to posting.
🚫 If both the frontmatter URL and the file-path-derived URL return 404, the note is skipped but BFS still follows its links to discover other content.
📋 URL validation is injected into `FindContentConfig` via the optional `fccPublicationChecker` callback.
⚡ URL checks are only performed on notes that pass all other content filters (postable and eligible), avoiding unnecessary HTTP requests during BFS traversal.

## 🤖 Post Text Generation

📝 Post text is generated using a two-step sequential Gemini AI pipeline. 📡 Calls are made sequentially to avoid rate limits.

### ❓ Step 1: Question Generation

🤖 A discussion question is generated using `buildQuestionPrompt` with the question model (default: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`).
📏 The question budget is calculated to fit within the Bluesky character limit (300) after accounting for the title, URL, prefix, and tag allowance.
🎯 Questions are prefixed with `#AI Q: ` in the final post.

### 🏷️ Step 2: Tags Generation

🤖 Emoji topic tags are generated using `buildTagsPrompt` with the tags model (default: `gemma-3-27b-it`).
📊 Tags use the format: `📚 Topic | 🤖 AI | 🧠 Thinking` with 2-4 concise tags.

### 🔧 Assembly

📝 The question and tags are combined and assembled into the final post structure:
- 📌 Title (from note frontmatter)
- ❓ AI question with `#AI Q: ` prefix (if generated)
- 🏷️ Topic tags (if generated)
- 🔗 URL (from note frontmatter)

✂️ If the assembled post exceeds the Bluesky character limit, the question is automatically shortened via a follow-up LLM call.
📏 The final post is then fitted to each platform's specific character limit using five progressive text-fitting strategies.

## 🐦 Twitter Integration

📤 Posts via the Twitter v2 API using OAuth 1.0a credentials with four keys: apiKey, apiSecret, accessToken, and accessSecret.
🔑 Each request includes a UUID-based `X-Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate tweets on retry after transient 503 errors.
🔄 Retries up to 3 times with a 1000ms base delay on failure.
🖼️ Embed generation tries the oEmbed API first with a dark theme, then falls back to a locally generated blockquote HTML.
📏 URLs always count as 23 characters regardless of actual length due to Twitter's t.co shortening rule.

## 🦋 Bluesky Integration

📤 Posts via the AT Protocol API with automatic RichText facet detection for clickable links and mentions.
🖼️ Supports rich link card embeds with title, description, and optional thumbnail image upload.
🔗 Extracts DID and post ID from AT Protocol URIs using pure parsing functions.
⏳ Embed retrieval includes a propagation delay retry with up to 2 attempts and a 2-second retry delay, since new posts may not be immediately available via oEmbed.
📝 Local embed fallback generates blockquote HTML with `data-bluesky-uri` and `data-bluesky-cid` attributes.

## 🐘 Mastodon Integration

📤 Posts via the Mastodon REST API with Bearer token authentication.
🌐 Instance-agnostic design extracts the instance URL from post URLs for API calls.
📝 Creates public, English-language statuses with JSON body containing status, visibility, and language fields.
🔁 Uses UUID-based Idempotency-Key headers for retry safety against duplicate posts.
🖼️ Embed generation tries the instance's oEmbed endpoint first, then falls back to an iframe-based embed.
🔧 Pure URL parsing functions extract instance URL, status ID, and username from post URLs.
🏗️ The `haskell/src/Automation/Platforms/Mastodon.hs` module follows the same error handling patterns as the Twitter module, using `Either Text` return types and `HttpCodeException` for transient failure retry.
🔌 All IO functions accept a `Manager` parameter for HTTP connection pooling.

## 🔍 OpenGraph Metadata Extraction

🌐 `fetchOgMetadata` fetches a URL via HTTPS and decodes the response body as UTF-8 using `decodeUtf8Lenient` for robust handling of non-UTF-8 bytes.
🔍 `extractOgProperty` parses `<meta property="og:*">` tags to extract title, description, and image URL by searching for `property="og:{name}" content="` markers.
🛡️ Returns partial results on incomplete metadata (`Nothing` for missing properties).
📷 `fetchImageAsBuffer` retrieves images as lazy ByteString buffers for blob uploads.
🏷️ `detectContentType` infers MIME type from the image URL extension (webp, png, gif, svg) with jpeg as the default fallback. Used by the Bluesky blob upload to set the correct `Content-Type` header.

## 📝 Embed Section Builders

🔧 `createSectionBuilder` is a higher-order function that returns a pure function for building markdown sections with a given header.
📝 Three platform-specific builders are created from this factory: `buildTweetSection`, `buildBlueskySection`, and `buildMastodonSection`.
🔧 `createSectionAppender` is a parallel higher-order function that returns an effectful function for appending sections to files with idempotency checks.
🛡️ Appenders skip writing if the section header already exists in the file content.
📏 Separator logic intelligently adds single or double newlines based on whether the existing content already ends with a newline.

## ✂️ Text Fitting Strategies

📏 The `fitPostToLimit` function implements five progressive strategies to fit text within a platform's character limit.

🔢 The strategies are applied in order, stopping as soon as the text fits.

1️⃣ Strategy one removes pipe-separated topic tags from right to left, trimming the least important tags first.
2️⃣ Strategy two removes the entire topic line and its preceding blank line.
3️⃣ Strategy three strips the subtitle from the title by removing everything after the first colon.
4️⃣ Strategy four removes the title entirely along with its following blank line.
5️⃣ Strategy five truncates the remaining content with an ellipsis while always preserving the URL line.

📏 `countGraphemes` uses the `Intl.Segmenter` API for Unicode-aware character counting where complex emoji like family sequences and flag pairs each count as one grapheme.
📐 `calculateTweetLength` accounts for Twitter's t.co URL shortening rule where every URL counts as exactly 23 characters regardless of actual length.
✅ `validateTweetLength` checks against Twitter's 280-character limit using the t.co-adjusted length.
