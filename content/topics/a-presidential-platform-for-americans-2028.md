# 🇺🇸🗣️💡🗓️ A Presidential Platform for Americans 2028  
  
## The Opportunity  
- Donald Trump has taught us that  
    - Americans want change  
    - Presidents wield immense power  
- As his abuses of power flood the country with violence and corruption, the rising American will for positive change presents a unique opportunity to elect a leader who will wield this immense power for good.  
- We need a wise, benevolent leader willing to fight for the people with every available tool.  
  
## Principles  
- Focus on real wealth. Money fails in the absence of real resources.  
- Solve problems immediately by any means necessary while building the infrastructure for robust, durable solutions that cannot be revoked by a future administration.  
  
## Priorities  
1. End poverty  
2. Strengthen democracy  
    1. Educate  
    2. Empower and expand civic participation  
    3. Fight disinformation  
  
## Ideas  
  
### The Job Guarantee  
- Effective immediately, the federal government guarantees a job to anyone willing to work.  
- Make America Great.  
    - We will finally step into our oft purported role as the greatest nation on earth by offering the best guaranteed benefits.  
    - The wages and benefits of the job guarantee immediately become a minimum bar to employing people in America, so private businesses will either match these new minimum standards or close their doors without the need for explicit laws or regulations.  
    - The benefits  
        - Food  
        - Housing  
        - Education  
        - Healthcare  
  
### Public Tech  
#### Social Media  
- Private social media companies sold out the American people.  
- There's no reason to continue to allow Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump to amass obscene personal wealth by empowering foreign governments, wealthy elites, and ideological zealots to spread propaganda and lies over today's most prevalent mass communication platforms.  
- Social media technology is easy to build and maintain.  
- A public social media platform will  
    - be free  
    - tie participation to government verified identity  
    - not sell advertising  
    - support, direct, and leverage research on algorithms that improve social cohesion rather than inspiring hate and division  
    - build free and open source software in the public domain  
    - operate transparently  
    - self govern democratically  
  
#### Gig Platform  
- We need not allow Uber, et. al. to siphon wealth from workers and consumers on every transaction made on the only viable gig work platforms.  
- A public gig work platform will  
    - allow the federal government to subsidize labor that supports public service goals, such as childcare and education  
  
### Patriot Metrics  
- Today we measure, mandate, and reward the hoarding of private profits and generate massive inequality.  
- In order to balance the scales, let's begin by measuring patriotism.  
- Patriot metrics measure the degree to which businesses improve the lives of their employees, customers, and communities.  
- Patriot metrics can drive change by  
    - spreading awareness, which allows individuals to support patriotic businesses and pressure greedy businesses to change  
    - enabling tax policies that incentivize patriotism  
    - allowing for the study, identification, and regulation of extremely unpatriotic practices  
- Examples  
    - Measuring the Geni coefficient across every employee of a business shows us how well that business distributes wealth internally  
    - Measuring the change of wealth distribution over time of a business' owners, customers, and surrounding communities can yield insights into exploitative pricing, lasting product and service value, and community impact
