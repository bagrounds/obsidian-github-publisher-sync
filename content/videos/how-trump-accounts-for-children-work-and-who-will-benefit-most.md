* 👶 Trump accounts establish tax advantaged savings vehicles for every American child up to age 18.  
* 🏦 The federal government provides a $1,000 seed deposit for children born between 2025 and 2028.  
* 📈 Parents can contribute up to $5,000 annually to maximize wealth building through compounding.  
* 🤝 Private philanthropists like Michael Dell are donating massive sums to boost these accounts.  
* ⚠️ Current structures may widen the wealth gap because wealthy families can afford the maximum contribution while poor families cannot.  
* 🎓 Funds at age 18 are restricted to housing, education, or business startups to avoid frivolous spending.  
* 📉 Penalties apply to early withdrawals for those not pursuing higher education, which may unfairly impact trade workers.  
* 🏛️ Success depends on bipartisan reforms to ensure the bottom 90% of Americans truly benefit.
