# 🏛️👎 Ex-Trump White House attorney calls Comey's indictment 'un-American and despicable'  
![Ex-Trump White House attorney calls Comey's indictment 'un-American and despicable'](https://youtu.be/TyjAHbin4U4)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* ⚖️ The process of the Comey indictment was worse than unusual, wholly un-American, and really despicable \[[00:32](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=32)].  
* 🇺🇸 Evenhanded justice has long been the country's standard and goal, and that has been abandoned under this president and his willing assistant attorney general \[[00:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=46)].  
* 🚫 Career prosecutors, including a U.S. attorney appointed by Trump, had concluded there was insufficient evidence to proceed against the former FBI director \[[01:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=66)].  
* 🔥 The president fired that prosecutor and ordered his attorney general to punish his enemies \[[01:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=93)].  
* 🚨 This is not the way America works; historically, it is the way Allende's Chile, Stalin's Russia, and Hitler's Germany worked \[[02:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=132)].  
* 🛡️ The role of an attorney general is not to do what the president orders in criminal matters \[[02:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=146)].  
* 🏛️ Previous attorney generals with character, such as Elliot Richardson and William Ruckelshaus, honored their oath to the Constitution by resigning rather than carrying out a presidential order \[[02:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=154)].  
* 🤯 The situation is a wholesale 180 from the norms that made America different from Third World dictatorships and authoritarian regimes \[[03:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=196)].  
* 👨‍⚖️ The case could well be dismissed because of vindictive prosecution, selective prosecution, or prosecutorial misconduct standards \[[03:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=214)].  
* 🤝 Second-term appointees were clearly slavishly devoted and willing to break any ethical or legal barriers to do the president's bidding \[[03:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=235)].  
* 👑 The president's crippling narcissism dictates every whim, including this vengeance tirade \[[04:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=282)].  
* 🛑 When the president wanted to take inappropriate action in the first term, strong and capable people acted as an inappropriate restraint and would say no \[[05:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=341)].  
* ✅ Now, whatever the narcissistic whim may be—vengeance, power, war crimes—people just say yes \[[06:01](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=361)].  
* 🚨 The attacks on the rule of law have so diminished it that it is a danger to all citizens \[[07:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=427)].  
* 💰 An example of unequal justice is a person presumably spending cash received as a bribe with no consequences, while James Comey is preparing for arraignment \[[07:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=450)].  
* 📜 The red line for loyalists is established by the oath they take to defend and protect or preserve and defend the Constitution \[[08:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyjAHbin4U4&t=487)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* ⚖️ The central perspective of this interview is that the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey is a **political act of vengeance** that represents a severe breach of **American constitutional norms** and the independence of the Justice Department.  
* Contrasting ⚔️ perspectives would argue that the indictment is a necessary step for **accountability and equal application of the law**, regardless of the President's personal motives.  
* Supporters of the indictment would reject the claim of "vindictive prosecution," asserting that the charges are based on **legitimate evidence** of misconduct by a high-ranking official who was previously shielded from scrutiny.  
* To gain a better understanding, it would be useful to explore **🔍 the specific legal and factual basis** of the Comey indictment and the **formal Department of Justice guidelines** for prosecuting high-level former officials.  
* Further research is needed on the **judicial history of vindictive and selective prosecution** claims to understand the high legal bar for getting a case dismissed on those grounds.
