### 📜 U.S. Immigration Policy Evolution  
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **1980s-1990s:** Shift from single Mexican male migrants to families and unaccompanied minors from Central America. Reagan administration's harsh stance on asylum, often denying refugee status despite evidence of atrocities, leading to the sanctuary movement.

## ⚖️ Evaluation  
* 📚 **Comprehensive Historical Context:** Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here provides a deeply reported, sweeping historical account of U.S. involvement in Central America from the Cold War to the present, effectively linking past interventions to current migration patterns. Blitzer's work is praised for its forensic detail and narrative approach, weaving personal stories with policy analysis.  
* 🚨 **Critique of U.S. Policy:** The book powerfully exposes the hypocrisy and schizophrenia of American policies and attitudes toward immigrants, highlighting how U.S.-backed meddling contributed to the destabilization of Central American nations. It argues that many current problems at the border are the inevitable 'harvest' from seeds sown by U.S. policy.  
* 🌍 **Focus on Northern Triangle:** While acclaimed for its depth regarding El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, some critics note that the book's extensive focus on the Cold War origins and these three countries might limit its discussion of broader contemporary factors, such as changing demographics of migrants from other regions (e.g., Venezuela, Haiti) or wider global economic trends impacting migration today.  
* ⚖️ **Balance of Factors:** The book, while emphasizing the U.S. role, acknowledges that poverty, injustice, violence, and corruption in Central America also have homegrown roots. However, it often shows how U.S. actions exacerbated these internal issues or failed to support those trying to address them.  
* 📝 **Policy Implications:** The book does not offer easy solutions but is considered invaluable for understanding how the crisis developed, aiding in plotting a humane way forward.
