## ✍🏼🤖 Blog Automation  
- 📂 I maintain several index pages for this site  
- ⚙️ The index on each of these pages is a dynamically computed dataview query  
- 📤 When I publish updates, those files are not seen as having been changed, but they need to be published to update the indices  
- 📉 This led to a pattern where I manually publish the indices that need to be updated on some cadence, which is a bit tedious  
- 📜 Now I've updated a script I run regularly to update a frontmatter timestamp in each of these files so that they will be marked as changed and 🤖 automatically published  
- 🧠 I had gemini-3-pro write the script, given the following prompt and it worked on the first try  
  
### 💬 Prompt  
> Here is an Obsidian templater script that I want to update. I want the script to set the value of an "updated" frontmatter field to the current timestamp (iso 8601) in the following files:  
> (List of files)  
> (Existing script)  
  
### ⌨️ New Code  
```js  
// Update 'updated' timestamp in specific index files  
const filesToUpdate = [  
  "index.md",  
  "articles/index.md",  
  "books/index.md",  
  "bot-chats/index.md",  
  "people/index.md",  
  "products/index.md",  
  "reflections/index.md",  
  "software/index.md",  
  "topics/index.md",  
  "videos/index.md",  
];  
  
// ISO 8601 Timestamp (Local Time with Offset)  
// Use .toISOString() instead if you prefer UTC (Zulu) time.  
const timestamp = moment().format();  
  
for (const path of filesToUpdate) {  
  const targetFile = tp.app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath(path);  
  
  // Check if file exists and is actually a file (not a folder/null)  
  if (targetFile instanceof tp.obsidian.TFile) {  
    await tp.app.fileManager.processFrontMatter(targetFile, (frontmatter) => {  
      frontmatter["updated"] = timestamp;  
    });  
  }  
}  
```  
  
## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
🌑 The mud didn’t just coat the 👞 boots; it drank. It was a thick, 🌑 black slurry, smelling of ⛓️ iron and the ancient, oily 🕳️ rot of the deep earth.  
  
⚙️ He felt the shift inside; the ❄️ old, cold machine in his chest clicking into place. It was a 🌓 transition of the soul, a brutal changing of the guard where the man ended and the ⚔️ weapon began. He drove his 🗡️ spear through a 🪖 soldier’s throat, a wet, mechanical thud that added another 🖋️ mark to a tally no one would ever read. One more 👻 soul spent; one more line of 📜 history scraped clean and written over in 🩸 red.  
  
⛰️ On the ridge, the men in 👔 silk stood behind 🔭 glass lenses, watching the ⚔️ slaughter with the fevered eyes of a man who’s gone too long without a fix. They didn't see 🩸 blood; they saw a 📖 clearing of the books. They craved the 🛢️ black bile beneath the soil - the grease that would turn their new world - and they would 🔥 burn every village from here to the sea just to move a line on a 🗺️ map.  
  
🗣️ To them, the screaming was just the ⚙️ friction of 📈 progress.  
  
🪓 He swung a heavy cleaver, his vision narrowing to a 🔴 scarlet pulse. There was no room for the intelligence of 🕊️ mercy here. Only the rhythmic, grinding work of the strike, the heavy price of a 👑 crown toppled into the 🌫️ dirt, and the crushing weight of a 📜 script that had been written long before he was born. He was just the 🖋️ ink, and the 📄 page was thirsty.
