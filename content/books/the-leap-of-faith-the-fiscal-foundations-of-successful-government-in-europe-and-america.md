## ⚖️ Evaluation  
  
* 🤔 The book effectively challenges simple political culture explanations for tax compliance, instead foregrounding the crucial role of institutional efficacy and state-citizen interactions.  
* 🗺️ Its comparative historical approach across diverse countries (Sweden, Italy, UK, US, Romania) provides a rich, nuanced understanding of state fiscal capacity development.  
* 📚 The emphasis on administrative capacity, fairness, and tangible public services aligns with existing scholarship on state-building and revenue mobilization, such as Margaret Levi's *On Rule and Revenue* (1988) and Sven Steinmo's *Taxation and Democracy* (1993), which are also acknowledged by the authors.  
* 🌟 The argument that willingly paying taxes requires a 'leap of faith' is a compelling theoretical contribution, highlighting the psychological and social contract elements beyond pure economic rationality.  
* 🧪 While the book incorporates experimental methods in its broader Willing to Pay? project, this specific volume uses historical institutional analysis to explain *why* compliance differs, complementing experimental findings.  
* ⚔️ It implicitly contrasts with analyses solely focusing on the impact of mass warfare on taxation, like Kenneth Scheve and David Stasavage's *Taxing the Rich: A History of Fiscal Fairness in the United States and Europe* (2016), by emphasizing broader institutional and fairness mechanisms over centuries, though war financing is a component of historical fiscal development.
