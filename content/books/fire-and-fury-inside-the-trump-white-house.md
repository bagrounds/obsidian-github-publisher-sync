### 📝 Summary  
  
📖 "Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House" by Michael Wolff provides a controversial, behind-the-scenes account of the first year of 🇺🇸 Donald Trump's presidency. 🗣️ Based on extensive access and interviews, the book portrays a 😵 chaotic and dysfunctional White House populated by staffers who largely viewed the 👨‍💼 President as unfit for office. ⚔️ It details infighting among senior advisors like Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, and Jared Kushner, and depicts Trump as easily influenced, often disengaged from policy, and driven by impulse and a need for validation. 🗓️ The narrative covers key early events, including the transition, the ➡️ firing of James Comey, and the initial responses to major policy challenges.
