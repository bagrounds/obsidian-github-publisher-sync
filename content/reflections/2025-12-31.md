## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
✨ The Junior Intelligence Academy was supposed to be a prestigious training ground. 🎓 Instead, it was a high-budget daycare for teenagers in ill-fitting suits. 👕👖 Their final exam? 📝 Infiltrate and Observe the Political Landscape. 🕵️‍♀️  
  
🌟 Agent Binkie and his squad took the instructions literally. 🤯 They found the most imposing bronze politician in the city square and decided that observing required a much better view. 🏞️ While Binkie spray-painted a massive NO 🚫 over the statue’s waistcoat, Agent Todd hoisted a cardboard sign that accurately reflected their collective academic interest: **POLITICS SUCKS**. 👎  
  
🌯 "Hold it, hold it!" ✋ Binkie shouted, clutching a half-eaten burrito. 🌮 "The lighting is peak! ☀️ Nobody move until the selfie uploads!" 📸  
  
🌇 As the sun set, the Immature Agents stood triumphant atop the statesman's head. 👑 They hadn't learned a single thing about legislative reform 📜 or diplomacy, 🤝 but they did manage to trend on TikTok 📱 for three hours before the actual secret service 🚓 arrived with handcuffs ⛓️ and juice boxes. 🧃 Politics was hard; 😓 being a nuisance was effortless. 😎
