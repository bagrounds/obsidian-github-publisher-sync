## 📖 Book Report: The Federalist Papers  
  
*The Federalist Papers* 📜 is a collection of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay under the pseudonym "Publius" between 1787 and 1788. 🗣️ Their primary purpose was to persuade the citizens of New York 🗽 to ratify the newly proposed United States Constitution. 🇺🇸 Although initially aimed at a New York audience, these essays have become a foundational text for understanding the U.S. Constitution and the intentions of its framers. 🤔
