* 📝 Write down every goal specifically because ideas stay as clouds in your brain until you codify them \[[00:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v__EK4Tj7n4&t=29)].

* 👣 Focus on small, manageable steps rather than trying to achieve massive transformations overnight \[[03:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v__EK4Tj7n4&t=194)].

* 🔙 Get back on the path immediately if you fail instead of letting one mistake ruin the entire campaign \[[12:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v__EK4Tj7n4&t=762)].  
* 🪞 Practice self confession by looking in the mirror and admitting when you are screwing up your progress \[[15:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v__EK4Tj7n4&t=924)].
