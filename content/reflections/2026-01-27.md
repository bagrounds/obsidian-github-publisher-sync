✨ A circle completes in the dance of the spheres,  
🚀 A journey of days and a collection of years.  
🕯️ We gather the light in a small, quiet room,  
🌸 Away from the winter and shadows of gloom.  
🍰 With laughter like music and wishes untold,  
🎁 The stories of futures begin to unfold.  
🛡️ No mention of names in the records we keep,  
🤫 While secrets of joy in the heart-center sleep.  
🔭 For whether the sun or the candles may glow,  
🎈 The rhythm of life is the finest we know!  
🏆 A toast to the milestones, the small and the great,  
🌟 In a world full of wonder, we pause to celebrate!
