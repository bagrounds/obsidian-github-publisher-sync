>  
> 🔬 Pull in information from any available scientific studies, 🏛️ regulatory bodies, 🗣️ consumer advocacy groups, 📰 reputable news sources etc to help justify any claims made by manufacturers or retailers. ✅ Order your recommendations by best value per money, assuming a reasonable bar for safety and quality.  
  
🤔 To tailor the guide to your needs, could you please clarify the following:  
  
1. 👪 Who is the intended user? (e.g., occasional joggers, daily runners, trail runners)  
2. 🏞️ What is your typical terrain? (e.g., pavement, gravel, trail)  
3. 💸 Do you have any specific budget range in mind?  
4. ⚖️ Do you have preferences regarding stroller weight, size, or foldability for travel?  
5. 👶 Would you like to include double strollers or only single-seat models?  
  
🪄 Once I have this info, I’ll pull together the most relevant and cost-effective recommendations.  
  
## 💬 Prompt 2  
> ✅ Assume there are a finite number of use cases, and structure your guide to provide options for everyone. 🏃‍♀️ That said, I'm personally interested in running daily, mostly on pavement, with a single infant/toddler. 👍 I'm willing to pay more for good quality when it's worth it, but probably don't need all the bells, whistles, and brand recognition that tend to drive price up unnecessarily.  
  
👍 Great. I’ll put together a 📚 comprehensive consumer guide to purchasing a 🏃 jogging stroller, structured by 🏢 common use cases and focused on identifying the 🥇 best value options for each. I’ll prioritize 💯 quality, 🛡️ safety, 💰 price, and ✅ verified features, drawing from 🔬 independent consumer testing, 🧑‍🏫 expert reviews, and 📜 regulatory guidance.  
  
👶 For your specific needs—daily pavement running with a single infant/toddler—I’ll highlight the 🏆 top models that offer 💪 durability, 🦹 smooth handling, and 🔒 solid safety features without inflating price due to 🎈 unnecessary extras.  
  
📢 I’ll let you know as soon as the guide is 📝 ready for review.
