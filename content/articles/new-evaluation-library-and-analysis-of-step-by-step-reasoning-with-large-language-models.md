# [📊🔎🤖🪜 New Evaluation, Library, and Analysis of Step By Step Reasoning with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05221)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
🤖 The paper introduces two key innovations to address challenges in Large Language Models (LLMs).  
* 📄 **AutoRace**: A fully automated evaluation method for reasoning chains that adapts to different tasks without human effort. It autonomously creates detailed evaluation criteria by summarizing errors in LLM-generated reasoning chains and then uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation.  
* 📚 **LLM Reasoners**: A unified library for standardized, modular implementation of reasoning algorithms. This library formulates different reasoning algorithms like Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), and Reasoning-via-Planning (RAP) under a unified perspective of a search process that maximizes accumulated rewards, comprising a reward function, a world model, and a search algorithm.  
* 🧠 **Key Findings**: An analysis of reasoning approaches reveals that reward-guided search improves final accuracy and reduces false-positive reasoning chains. The breadth of search is generally more important than the depth for most tasks. Incorporating a world model can effectively improve LLM reasoning, particularly in embodied environments. The prompt format design can also inadvertently lead to false-positive reasoning chains.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* 🆚 **Comparison:** The paper's new method, AutoRace, is contrasted with existing evaluation metrics. Existing metrics often rely on expensive human annotations or predefined prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically tailors evaluation criteria for each task. The paper demonstrates that AutoRace outperforms other LLM-based metrics and is better at detecting false-positive reasoning chains without misclassifying correct ones, unlike SocREval.  
* 🔭 **Further Exploration:** To gain a better understanding, one could explore the specific technical implementation of the `AutoRace` criteria list construction and the modular components of the `LLM Reasoners` library. It would also be valuable to investigate how to design prompts more effectively for different reasoning domains, as the paper notes that prompt design should be tailored to the task. Finally, the paper identifies that tasks requiring strong planning abilities, such as Game-24 and Blocksworld, remain unsolved, which presents an open area for future research.
