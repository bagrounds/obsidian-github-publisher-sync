## 🤖 AI Summary  
• 👨‍💻 John Mueller from 🏢 Google advises against using too many 🔗 internal links on a single page, as it can 😕 confuse 🤖 Google's understanding of a 🗺️ website's structure and 💧 dilute the value of individual links.  
  
• ⚠️ Overusing 🔗 internal links makes it 😥 difficult for 🤖 Google to determine which 📍 pages are most important, 🚧 hindering the search engine's ability to understand the site's 🏛️ hierarchy and Context ℹ️.  
  
• 💡 Instead of excessive 🔗 linking, 🤖 Google recommends a 🧠 logical structure mirroring the 🕸️ website's organization, such as 🏠 homepage to 📂 category page to 🛍️ product page, or ✍️ contextual links in 📰 blog articles.  
  
• ✅ Using fewer, well-placed 🔗 internal links sends 📣 stronger signals to 🤖 Google about 📍 page importance and 🚀 improves the chances of relevant 📍 pages appearing in 🔍 search results.
