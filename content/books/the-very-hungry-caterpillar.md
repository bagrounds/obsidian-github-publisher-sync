## 🐛 Book Report: The Very Hungry Caterpillar

### 🐛 Summary  
  
* 🥚 The story begins with a tiny egg on a leaf. 🐛 On Sunday morning, a small, very hungry caterpillar hatches and immediately starts looking for food. 🍎 Over the next five days, he eats increasing amounts of fruit: one apple on Monday, 🍐 two pears on Tuesday, 🫐 three plums on Wednesday, 🍓 four strawberries on Thursday, and 🍊 five oranges on Friday. 🐛 Despite this, he is still hungry. 🍫 On Saturday, he devours a large assortment of junk food, resulting in a stomach ache 🤕. 🍃 To feel better, he eats a single green leaf on Sunday. 🐛 Now a "big, fat caterpillar," he builds a cocoon 🛌 around himself and stays inside for over two weeks. 🦋 Finally, he emerges as a beautiful, multi-colored butterfly.
