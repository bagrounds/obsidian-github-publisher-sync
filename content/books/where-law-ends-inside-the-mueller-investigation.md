## ⚖️ Evaluation  
Andrew Weissmann's *Where Law Ends* provides a unique, first-person perspective on the internal workings and challenges of the Mueller investigation, offering a critical look at its leadership and decisions. Weissmann, a lead prosecutor, argues the team was overly cautious and failed to fully pursue obstruction charges against President Trump or adequately investigate his finances. He specifically criticizes the decision not to subpoena the President and the team's silence on concluding obstruction, which he believes left room for Attorney General William Barr's "misleading" summary of the report.  
  
However, the book's main points have drawn both agreement and significant counterpoints from high-quality, objective sources. Robert Mueller himself issued a rare public statement calling Weissmann's criticisms "disappointing" and "based on incomplete information," asserting that "when important decisions had to be made, I made them." Other legal analysts and former prosecutors have questioned Weissmann's decision to publish an insider account, suggesting it could violate norms of prosecutorial conduct and present a one-sided view of internal deliberations. The Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions, which prohibit the indictment of a sitting president, were a significant constraint on the investigation's ability to formally charge Trump, a factor Mueller's team adhered to. While the Mueller Report explicitly stated it "does not exonerate" Trump on obstruction, it did not make a prosecutorial judgment due to the OLC opinion. These objective sources highlight the complex legal and political environment in which the Mueller investigation operated, suggesting that the team's decisions, while critiqued by Weissmann, were often made within established legal boundaries and under immense political pressure.
