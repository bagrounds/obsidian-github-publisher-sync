## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 🤔 Q: What is the core disagreement between the New Brandeis School and the Chicago School of antitrust thought?  
💰 A: The **Chicago School** emphasizes the **consumer welfare standard**, arguing antitrust enforcement should primarily focus on low consumer prices and economic efficiency. The **New Brandeis School**, championed by Lina Khan, argues that antitrust must prioritize **diffusing private economic power, protecting democracy, and ensuring fair market structures** for workers and small businesses, believing the consumer welfare standard is too narrow.  
  
### 🧐 Q: What is the significance of Lina Khan's law school paper, Amazon's Antitrust Paradox?  
📚 A: The paper is highly significant because it **challenged the core assumption of modern antitrust law** that a company like Amazon could not be a monopoly if it provided low prices to consumers. Khan argued this price-centric view was **unequipped to analyze the market power** of platform-based businesses, effectively launching the intellectual foundation for the **New Brandeis movement** and its push for reform.  
  
### 🏛️ Q: How has the Federal Trade Commission's focus changed under the leadership of Lina Khan?  
🚀 A: The **FTC's focus shifted from passive enforcement to aggressive intervention** aimed at corporate structure and market power. This includes using FTC rules to tackle issues like **non-compete clauses** and **junk fees**, bringing high-profile lawsuits against major tech monopolies, and expanding the definition of harm beyond just short-term price increases.

### 🆚 Contrasting  
* 📘 The Antitrust Paradox: A Policy at War With Itself by Robert H Bork established the **consumer welfare standard** as the sole legitimate goal of antitrust, which is the exact legal and economic framework that Khan's entire career has been dedicated to challenging.  
* 📙 Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists: Unleashing the Power of Financial Markets to Create Wealth and Spread Opportunity by Raghuram G Rajan and Luigi Zingales argues that competitive markets are often undermined by incumbents who lobby for anti-competitive regulation, suggesting that government intervention can stifle, rather than promote, true market dynamism, a view often held by critics of Khan's broad regulatory approach.
