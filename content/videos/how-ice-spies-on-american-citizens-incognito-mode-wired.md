# 🕵️🇺🇸💻👁️ How ICE Spies On American Citizens | Incognito Mode | WIRED  
![How ICE Spies On American Citizens | Incognito Mode | WIRED](https://youtu.be/4QUG8czGScU)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* 🕵️ **Social Media Surveillance:** ICE 🛂 is reportedly expanding its use of social media surveillance to monitor individuals who post about anti-ICE sentiments \[[00:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=48)]. A tool 💻 called Social Net can monitor over 200 websites and platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Reddit \[[01:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=64)]. This mass data collection may discourage individuals from exercising their First Amendment rights \[[01:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=100)].  
* 👀 **Facial Recognition:** ICE officials have long used facial recognition at the border, but agents now have an app called Mobile Fortify 🤳 that allows them to scan faces and run them through various databases \[[02:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=142)]. This technology has a margin of error that could lead to false positives and the potential detention of U.S. citizens \[[02:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=167)]. There are no federal laws ⚖️ regulating its use by law enforcement agencies \[[03:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=184)].  
* 📜 **Data Broker Loophole:** ICE uses data brokers like Lexus Nexus to access vast amounts of information on individuals, including family members, criminal history, and personal assets \[[03:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=229)]. This allows the agency to bypass legal processes like subpoenas or warrants \[[04:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=253)].  
* 🚔 **Deputizing Local Police:** Through a program known as 287G, ICE can deputize local and state police to assist with deportation actions \[[04:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=275)]. This may erode community trust in police and divert local law enforcement resources away from other issues \[[05:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=310)].  
* 🤝 **Impact on Citizens:** ICE's expanding power is also affecting U.S. citizens, with law enforcement building dossiers on protesters and even arresting citizens who are near ICE raids \[[05:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=353)].  
* ➡️ **Future Expansion:** The video states that ICE has become one of the most dominant law enforcement agencies and is set to expand further under a potential second Trump administration, which has promised mass deportations \[[06:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=400)]. It highlights that 65% of those targeted by ICE have no criminal convictions and that agents are arresting people at courthouses and targeting green card holders \[[07:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QUG8czGScU&t=440)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
The video's perspective is 📢 critical of the expansion of ICE's power, framing it as a ⚠️ threat to civil liberties that affects 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 citizens and non-citizens alike. It highlights the potential for 👮 abuse of surveillance technologies and ⚖️ legal loopholes. A contrasting perspective might argue that these measures are necessary for 🛡️ national security and 🛂 immigration enforcement, and that the 🗂️ data collection and 👮 deputization of local police are essential tools for a more efficient and effective system. To gain a better understanding, it would be useful to explore the official justifications for these programs from a 🏛️ government or 👮 law enforcement perspective, as well as examine 📊 data from sources that track the effectiveness of these tactics in reducing illegal immigration or crime.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
  
* Permanent Record by Edward Snowden: A look at the history of government surveillance and a first-hand account of the NSA's mass data collection programs.  
* [🧑🏿⛓️🙈 The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness](../books/the-new-jim-crow-mass-incarceration-in-the-age-of-colorblindness.md) by Michelle Alexander: Examines the American justice system and how it has created a new caste system through mass incarceration, offering a parallel to the video's discussion of targeting and surveillance.  
* The Great Chain of Numbers: A Political History of Statistics as a Science and an Art by Lorena Dezso: Provides historical context on how governments have used data and statistics to manage populations, offering a different lens through which to view the video's discussion of data brokering and surveillance.
