# How to Force Your Brain To Be Motivated (when you don‚Äôt feel like it)  
  
- Motivation is fickle  
- Anything that depends on motivation will also be fickle  
- How can we avoid motivation-dependent productivity?  
- Break the automatic links between feelings and thoughts or thoughts and actions

## The DFUZ ("defuse") Method  
- **Distinguish** between feelings, thoughts, and actions  
  - Feeling demotivated does not require acting demotivated  
- **Fake** the emotion you'd like to have by acting like someone who displays that emotion  
- **Uptime**  
  - gradually increase the amount of time we can act differently than how we feel  
- **Zone**  
  - Create a zone of focus  
  - Note distractions as they occur  
  - Systematically eliminate distractions from the zone
