## 🏋🏻 Practice  
[Minimum added integer v2](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-integer-added-to-array-ii)  
```ts  
// assumes that inputs are sorted  
const valid = (nums1: number[], nums2: number[], x: number): boolean => {  
  for (let i = 0, extra = 0; i < nums2.length; i++) {  
    while (nums2[i] !== nums1[i + extra] + x) {  
      if (++extra > 2) return false  
    }  
  }  
  return true  
}  
  
function minimumAddedInteger(nums1: number[], nums2: number[]): number {  
  // optimization: all deletion choices are valid when nums2 contains 1 element  
  // so no need to sort or check for validity explicitly  
  // note: this optimization offers a tiny savings for the easiest inputs, so the cost if maintaining this code is probably greater than the value of keeping it  
  if (nums2.length === 1) return nums2[0] - Math.max(...nums1)  
  
  // we could do better by selecting the 3 smallest instead of doing a full sort  
  // sorting is O(N*log(N))  
  // selecting is O(N)  
  // but we need them fully sorted  to test for valid results efficiently  
  nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b)  
  nums2.sort((a, b) => a - b)  
  
  // key insight: at least 1 of the 1st 3 elements of nums1 will be its minimum after deleting 2 elements  
  // if we pick an element that must have been deleted, our solution may be invalid, so we test for validity  
  // it's possible that more than 1 solution works, so return the best valid solution  
  return [0, 1, 2].reduce((best, firstIndex) => {  
    const x = nums2[0] - nums1[firstIndex]  
    // optimization: if a candidate solution is bigger than our currently best valid solution, we won't use it, so don't waste time checking if it's valid  
    return best > x && valid(nums1, nums2, x) ? x : best  
  }, Infinity)  
}  
```
