## 📜 The Ledger of Sovereignty 🏛️  
  
In realms where the 💰 **fiat flows** and the 📜 debt is a name,  
A fresh fiscal doctrine ignites a new 🔥 flame.  
It's 💡 **Modern Monetary Theory**, a challenging call,  
To the orthodox wisdom that governs us all.  
  
The sovereign state, with its 🖨️ **printing press might**,  
Need not fear the 📈📉 bond market, day or through night.  
For the currency it issues, its own, from the start,  
Means a different relationship for the governmental heart.  
  
They whisper, "The Treasury can 🚫 **never run bare**,"  
Of its own native coinage—a comforting snare,  
Or a truth oft-forgotten? The key, they attest,  
Is not revenue-raising, but what is the test...🤔  
  
The 🧱 **real resource limit** is the constraint they observe,  
If factories are idle and workers preserve  
Their time without labor, then the spending should fly, 🚀  
To hire them and build things, beneath the wide sky.  
  
The focus is shifted: from deficits that loom,  
To the 🔥 **inflation** that spell economic doom.  
Taxes are levers, a tool to control 🛠️  
The aggregate demand that might burn up the whole.  
  
For taxes aren't needed to fund every quest,  
But to *mop up* the money when the economy's blessed  
With too much demand, to cool down the heat, 🌡️  
And keep prices from rising on every main street.  
  
A 🤝 **Job Guarantee** promise, a floor and a right,  
To steady the wages and lend people might.  
This anchor, they argue, a buffer so wide,  
Is a check on the system, where labor can hide.  
  
So let the bond vigilantes look on with disdain,  
MMT's adherents shout out through the rain:  
"The budget is not like a 🏠 household's small purse,  
When the state is the *issuer*, and not the reverse!"  
  
A complex prescription, a 💭 dream or a 👿 curse?  
A debate for the thinkers, for better or worse.  
It re-frames the horizon, a powerful, new view,  
Of what a sovereign power has the mandate to do. 👑
