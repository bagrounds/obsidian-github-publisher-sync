# [⚙️🛡️🐛 Making Reliable Distributed Systems in the Presence of Software Errors](https://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### TL;DR 💡  
  
This thesis introduces the Erlang programming language, the OTP design methodology, and a set of libraries for building fault-tolerant systems, addressing the challenge of creating reliable systems from programs that may contain errors. 🎉🚀✨  
  
### New or Surprising Perspective 😮  
  
The approach of "Concurrency Oriented Programming" (COP) is a notable shift from traditional object-oriented programming. 🤯💡🌟 COP emphasizes structuring programs around the concurrent nature of the application, which aligns more closely with real-world interactions and provides advantages like polymorphism and defined protocols. 🤝🌐💻 The concept of designing systems with the expectation of errors, and incorporating mechanisms for fault-tolerance from the outset, presents a practical and resilient perspective on software development. 💪🛡️🛠️  
  
### Deep Dive 🤿  
  
This thesis explores the construction of reliable software systems, even when the software components themselves may contain errors. 🧐🔍🔬  
  
**Key Topics**:  
  
* **Concurrency Oriented Programming (COP)**: A programming style where the concurrent structure of the program mirrors the concurrent structure of the application. 🔄👯‍♀️🔗  
  
* **Fault-Tolerance**: Strategies and techniques for building systems that can operate reliably in the presence of software errors. 🛠️🛡️🚧  
  
* **Erlang Programming Language**: Design and features of Erlang, focusing on its support for concurrency, error handling, and distributed programming. 💻🌐🚀  
  
* **OTP (Open Telecom Platform)**: A set of libraries and design principles for building fault-tolerant systems in Erlang. 📚🛠️💡  
  
* **Supervision Trees**: Hierarchical structures for managing and recovering from errors in a system. 🌳📈🛠️  
  
**Methods and Research**:  
  
* The research involved the development of the Erlang programming language and the OTP system. 🧪🔬💻  
  
* Case studies of large, commercially successful products (like the Ericsson AXD301) that use Erlang and OTP are presented to demonstrate the practical application and effectiveness of the concepts. 📈📊💼  
  
**Theories, Theses, and Mental Models**:  
  
* **Concurrency Oriented Programming (COP)**: The core idea is to structure programs around concurrency, using processes that communicate via message passing. 💬🔄👯‍♀️ This approach facilitates fault isolation and aligns with systems that model or interact with the real world. 🌍🤝💻  
  
* **Fault-Tolerance by Design**: The thesis posits that fault-tolerance should be a primary design consideration. 🛡️🛠️💡 By structuring software into a hierarchy of tasks and using error detection and recovery mechanisms, systems can be built to handle errors effectively. 💪🛡️🛠️  
  
* **The "Let it Crash" Philosophy**: This error-handling philosophy suggests that it is often better to allow a process to terminate if it encounters an unrecoverable error. 💥🔥🔄 Other processes, designed as supervisors, can then take appropriate actions such as restarting the failed process. 🔄🛠️🚀  
  
**Prominent Examples**:  
  
* **Ericsson AXD301**: A large, highly reliable ATM switch built with Erlang and OTP. 📞🌐🚀 It serves as a key case study in the thesis, demonstrating the ability of Erlang/OTP to create complex, fault-tolerant systems. 📈📊💼  
  
* **Bluetail Mail Robustifier**: An Erlang-based product designed to enhance the reliability of email services. 📧🛡️🛠️ It highlights Erlang's use in improving internet services. 🌐🚀📧  
  
**Practical Takeaways**:  
  
* **Design for Fault-Tolerance**: Assume that software will contain errors and design systems with mechanisms to detect and recover from these errors. 🛡️🛠️💡  
  
* **Use Concurrency for Fault Isolation**: Utilize processes with strong isolation (no shared data) to prevent errors in one part of the system from affecting other parts. 👯‍♀️🔗🛡️  
  
* **Implement Supervision Hierarchies**: Organize processes into supervision trees where supervisor processes monitor and manage worker processes, restarting them if necessary. 🌳📈🛠️  
  
* **Apply the "Let it Crash" Philosophy**: In error handling, focus on designing processes that can fail cleanly, with the expectation that other parts of the system will handle recovery. 💥🔥🔄  
  
* **Abstract Non-Functional Requirements**: Separate the code that implements the core functionality of the system from the code that handles non-functional requirements like error recovery and code upgrades. 🛠️🚀💡  
  
**Specific Advice, Guidance, and Techniques**:  
  
* **Structuring Systems with COP**: Structure applications as a set of communicating processes, where the structure of the code reflects the structure of the problem being solved. 💬🔄👯‍♀️  
  
* **Using Behaviors**: Utilize predefined components (behaviors) provided by OTP, such as `gen_server`, `gen_event`, and `gen_fsm`, to build common system components. 📚🛠️💡  
  
* **Implementing Fault-Tolerant Servers**: Design servers that can handle errors gracefully, including the ability to change code without stopping the server. 🛡️🛠️🚀  
  
* **Creating Supervision Trees**: Build hierarchies of processes where supervisors manage workers, defining how errors are propagated and handled. 🌳📈🛠️  
  
* **Handling Errors with "Let it Crash"**: Implement error detection in processes, but allow processes to terminate if recovery is not possible, relying on supervisors to restart them. 💥🔥🔄  
  
### Critical Analysis 🤔  
  
Armstrong's work provides a comprehensive approach to building reliable distributed systems. 🚀🌐🛠️ The development of Erlang and OTP has been driven by practical needs in the telecom industry, resulting in a system that has been proven in large-scale applications. 📈📊💼 The emphasis on fault-tolerance as a primary design goal, rather than an afterthought, is a key strength of the work. 💪🛡️💡  
  
The thesis is supported by case studies of real-world systems, including the Ericsson AXD301, which provide evidence for the effectiveness of the approach. 📈📊💼 These case studies offer valuable insights into the challenges and successes of applying Erlang and OTP in practice. 🧐🔍💡  
  
While the focus is primarily on software aspects, the importance of considering both software and hardware failures is acknowledged. 💻🔧🌐 The thesis also discusses the limitations of the current implementations and suggests areas for future work, demonstrating a commitment to continuous improvement. 🛠️🚀📈
