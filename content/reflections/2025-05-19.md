## 🤔 Performance Levers  
- People intuit levers but push the wrong way.  
- Struggling at work?  
    - Intuition: work more -> burnout -> performance declines  
    - Counterintuitive: work less -> rest -> performance increases  
- Rest has negative (balancing) feedback.  
    - The more you rest, the less you want.
