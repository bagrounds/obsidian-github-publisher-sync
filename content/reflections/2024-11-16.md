# 2024-11-16 | 🤔 Qualities 👥  
## 🤔 What's the most valuable quality a person can have?  
- 🧠 Intelligence is nice  
  - 🤔 but it doesn't get things done on its own  
  - ⚔️ and difference can breed violence. 😔 Too much intelligence can lead to bullying, for example.  
- ❤️ Kindness is nice  
  - 🥰 literally  
  - 😃 and it tends to be infectious, which is even better  
  - 🌎 but its value is still context dependent  
    - 🚨 all the kindness in the world may not help during a mugging  
- 🤸 Flexibility  
  - ⚙️ is useful in many contexts  
  - 😴 but it's passive  
- 🐒 Adaptability  
  - 💪 seems like flexibility with an active component  
  - 🧬 it is the trait that chases survival in evolution  
  - 😥 but is survival all we can hope for?  
- 🎨 Creativity  
  - ✨ allows us to do more than adapt to our environment  
  - 🌈 we can envision a better world and work to create it  
  - 🎭 but many creative individuals working on their own may have different visions, which may produce conflict  
- 🤝 Collaborativity  
  - 🕊️ resolves the potential conflict when multiple people create  
  - 🔨 but building together doesn't necessarily mean building good things together  
- 🧭 Leadership  
  - 👨‍✈️ is like guiding a collaborative effort  
  - ❓ but how do you ensure you're leading in a good direction?  
  
It feels like these qualities may combine to form a lattice...🕸️

🤔 Is there a word for wise, benevolent leadership?
