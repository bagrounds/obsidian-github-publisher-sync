# 🧠🤝🐘 Jonathan Haidt  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
👨‍🏫 Jonathan Haidt is a prominent American social psychologist and author. He is currently the 🎓 Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at the New York University Stern School of Business. 🧠 His work primarily focuses on the psychology of morality and moral emotions.  
  
🌟 Some of his key contributions and ideas include:  
  
-  **[❤️‍🩹⚖️🤝👑😇🗽 Moral Foundations Theory](../topics/moral-foundations-theory.md):** 🧠 This theory, which he co-developed, proposes that human moral reasoning is not based solely on logic, but is rooted in a set of innate, intuitive foundations. These foundations include care/harm, fairness/cheating, loyalty/betrayal, authority/subversion, and sanctity/degradation. ⚖️ A sixth foundation, liberty/oppression, has also been added. 🌍 He uses this framework to explain why people with different political ideologies often have different moral priorities.  
* 🐶 The Social Intuitionist Model: This model argues that moral judgments are primarily driven by fast, automatic moral intuitions, and that moral reasoning is often used after the fact to justify those initial intuitions. 🐕‍🦺 He describes this using the metaphor of an "emotional dog and its rational tail."  
  
✍️ Haidt is also known for his widely-read books that explore these concepts for a general audience:
