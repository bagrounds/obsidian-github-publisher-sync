# 😴💰🏛️🤑👴🇸🇪 ‘We got lazy and complacent’: Swedish pensioners explain how abolishing the wealth tax changed their country  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* 👴 Swedish pensioners observe the erosion of the welfare state they built, viewing the abolition of the wealth tax as a catalyst for social decline.  
* 📉 We became lazy and complacent, assuming the welfare model was permanent while failing to realize society was shifting toward a haven for billionaires.  
* 💰 The wealth tax was historically framed as a practical, non-political tool to fund essential public services like schools, dental care, and sports for children.  
* 🚪 Its removal in 2006 was initially seen as a pragmatic administrative fix rather than a radical ideological shift toward neoliberalism.  
* 🏗️ A once-natural culture of collective contribution has been replaced by individualistic desires to minimize personal tax burdens and accumulate private wealth.  
* 😰 Concerns persist that current generations will lack the social security and public infrastructure that protected their parents during the post-war era.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* 🧪 **The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)**: In the paper Taxing Top Wealth: Migration Responses and their Aggregate Economic Implications, researchers found that while abolishing the wealth tax reduced the out-migration of wealthy entrepreneurs by 30%, the overall economic spillover effects on employment and investment were modest.  
* 📉 **Association for Heterodox Economics**: In The Swedish Welfare Model: Counter-arguments to Neoliberal Myths, economist Daniel Ankarloo argues that the disarray of the Swedish model was not caused by high taxes, but by deliberate neoliberal policy shifts starting in the 1980s.  
* 🎓 **SH DiVA (Digitala Vetenskapliga Arkivet)**: A peer-reviewed dissertation from Lund University notes that the abolition of inheritance and wealth taxes was framed by politicians as a pragmatic administrative fix to avoid a normative debate on ethics.  
* 🔍 **World Inequality Database (WID)**: Managed by the Paris School of Economics, this database shows that while Sweden's tax-to-GDP ratio remains high, the specific burden on capital has decreased significantly since the mid-2000s, allowing private wealth to accumulate at the top.
