    * Ignores useful negative feedback. 🙈  
    * Feels threatened by the success of others. 😟  
* **Growth Mindset:**  
    * Belief that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. 🌱  
    * Embraces challenges as opportunities for growth. 💪  
    * Sees effort as the path to mastery. 🛤️  
    * Learns from criticism. 💡  
    * Finds inspiration in the success of others. 🤩

**📚 Book Recommendations:**  
* **Best Alternate Book on the Same Topic:** [❤️‍🔥💪 Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance](./grit-the-power-of-passion-and-perseverance.md) by Angela Duckworth. This book explores a related concept, highlighting the importance of grit in achieving long-term goals. 🌟  
* **Best Tangentially Related Book:** "[Thinking, Fast and Slow](./thinking-fast-and-slow.md)" by Daniel Kahneman. This book delves into the cognitive biases that influence our thinking and decision-making, providing a broader understanding of how our minds work. 🧠  
* **Best Diametrically Opposed Book:** "The Talent Code: Greatness Isn't Born. It's Grown." by Daniel Coyle. While not strictly opposed, it emphasizes deliberate practice and myelination, which could be seen as a more mechanistic view of talent development compared to Dweck’s more psychological approach. 🏗️
