## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
### ❓ Q: What is the primary purpose of taxes according to Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)?  
💡 A: According to MMT, the primary purpose of taxes for a sovereign currency issuer is not to fund government spending. 🪙 Instead, taxes are necessary to create an ongoing demand for the government's currency and to manage the economy by removing excess money to control inflation.  
  
### ❓ Q: How does MMT define public debt?  
💵 A: Modern Monetary Theory defines public debt as the cumulative total of dollars spent by the government into the economy that have not yet been used by the public to pay taxes. 🏦 This debt represents non-government savings in the form of outstanding tax credits.  
  
### ❓ Q: How does raising interest rates affect the economy?  
⬆️ A: Raising interest rates is an increase in government spending. 💸 The government pays higher interest on its outstanding securities, injecting more dollars into the private sector without raising taxes to offset the spending.
