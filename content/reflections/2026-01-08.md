## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
🏹 The arrow 🛡️ skips off scales. 🏹 Bow forgotten, he lunges, 🖐️ fingers clawing the 🌊 riverbed for a 🪨 jagged rock. 💥 Stone slams into a 🦎 scaly knee and 🧱 shatters.  
  
🐍 A tail whips, 🦴 cracking ribs and throwing him into the 🪵 dirt. 🌀 He rolls deep into the 👹 beast's reach, 🌪️ scooping stinging silt to hurl at 👁️ slitted eyes. 👄 The creature snaps blindly. 🗡️ A hand hits the belt-knife, finding the 🪓 sheath crushed flat, but a 🪵 shard of broken bow serves instead. 🪵 He drives splintered wood toward the 🧣 throat until the 💥 tip explodes against a neck ridge.  
  
🖐️ Nails lock 👂 into an ear-hole, swinging his weight behind the neck. 💫 The creature spins, pitching him toward a ⛓️ tangle of rusted iron. 🖐️ Fingers lock around a 🔗 link, swinging a 🌬️ whistling arc that snags a 🦏 horn and jerks him off his feet. 💦 He drops, hitting 🌊 shallow water face down. 🍞 Like this morning’s buttered toast, he's 💨 forgotten as the 🐉 beast wanders off in search of 🥓 bacon.
