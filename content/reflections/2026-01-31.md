☄️ I read of a man in a ship in the sky,  
👽 With a spider-like friend and a very sad eye.  
⚔️ Then I looked at a school where the students are mean,  
👑 The grumpiest rascals that I’ve ever seen.  
  
📊 But then came the robot, the FitBit-ish bot,  
🤖 To tell me if I was quite healthy or not.  
🫀 It looked at my ticker! It looked at my toes;  
📈 It tracked every thump from my head to my nose.  
  
🏃 Your HRV's low! said the AI with glee,  
💨 You must run through the hills and be fast as a flea.  
💡 With a Many-Project and an Insight or two,  
🌍 There’s no limit at all to the things you can do!
