### ⭐ Key Principles of Eisenhower's Leadership

* ⚖️ **The "Middle Way":** As president, Eisenhower championed a centrist approach, seeking national unity and outcomes that benefited the whole country rather than catering to political extremes.  
* 🕊️ **Humility and Self-Mastery:** Despite his immense power, Eisenhower remained humble and worked to control a formidable temper, prioritizing the nation's welfare over personal recognition. 🚫 He avoided making emotional decisions.
