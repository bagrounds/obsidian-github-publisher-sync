## 🤔 Titles are hard...  
... but they can also be fun 🥳.  
💎 I made a [Gemini](../software/gemini.md) Gem to help out.  
  
### ✒️ Title Craft  
> Help me come up with a concise, catchy title for the following.  
> First, come up with broad categories that fit the content.  
> Continue to combine the categories until they no longer overlap.  
> Then, come up with single word for each category that combined make a concise, catchy title.  
> Finally, choose one emoji for each word.  
> Format the result as follows:  
> Emoji1 Category1 | Emoji2 Category2 | ...  
> Or use a short title with emojis  
> Present many options. Then present some more. Inject a lot of variety and explain the rationale.  
  
📜 I have 127 old posts to title.

## 🪞🕸️🪵 Reflecting on Reflections  
🗓️ It's almost been a year since I started blogging 🤯.  
[2024-04-19 | 👋 Hello, World! 🌎](./2024-04-19.md)  
🧮 This is my 128th daily reflection 🪞.  
🎲 Well... not all of them are very reflective.  
Sometimes this feels more like a log 🪵.  
A log 🪵 on the web 🕸️.  
A 🕸️🪵 weblog  
A blog 🌐.  
👌 And that's okay.  
  
## 🔬 Tiny Blogging 🤏  
🎯 My goal was to make it very easy to blog.  
✅ That way I'd be more likely to do it.  
🤏 A [Tiny Habit](../books/tiny-habits.md).  
✅ It's been very easy.  
📱 I write from my phone.  
📝 I've made templates.  
🤖 I've automated.  
  
## 🤖 AI-Generated Content 📝  
🤖 I've recently started generating content with AI tools 🤖.  
😬 I'd been accumulating more empty posts for books than I was comfortable with 😬.  
📚 This site exists to serve as a reference for myself and others 📚.  
📝 I read a lot of good books and want to share my notes 📝.  
🤔 But it's easier to read than it is to write 🤔, especially when reading audio books 😁👂.  
📖 So I've read a lot more books than I've written notes on 📖.  
💸 A blank page isn't very valuable 💸.  
🤯 And a few fragmented sentences on a fragment of the content are not much better 🤯.  
⏱️ AI tools can generate a book report nearly instantly ⏱️.  
😐 It's not my writing. It's not perfect 😐.  
🙌 But it's better than nothing 🙌.  
💡 And with some iterative prompt engineering, I'm pretty happy with the quality of book reports I'm generating 💡.  
💯 Not perfect, but valuable 💯.  
  
## 🌐 Networked Book Exploration 📚  
🌐 And networked.  
📚 Generating a book report with book recommendations is a great way to explore.  
🗺️ I ask for books that relate in a variety of ways in order to cover more ground.  
🤔 It's fun to think of prompts that increase variety and breath in recommendations.  
🔍 How do you explore a space relative to a starting point you can't see yet?  
  
### 🧭 Generic Relationships for Blind Book Exploration  
- ➡️ similar  
- ⬅️ opposite  
- ⬆️ more general  
- ⬇️ more specific  
- 🔬 more rigorous  
- 🤝 more accessible  
- 📖 fictional  
  
## 📐 Multidimensional Exploration 🧭  
📐 What dimensions meaningfully characterize books?  
🤔 Maybe I can find some more.  
- ⚖️ **Rigor vs Accessibility**  
- 🌐 **Generality vs Specificity**  
- 📈 **Popularity vs Obscurity**  
  
📏 It's easy to explore along these 1-dimensional scales.  
  
### 🎭 Categorical Exploration Challenges 🧩  
🎭 It's hard to explore categorical spaces.  
🔄 I can ask for a book on an opposing topic.  
➖ But topics don't live on a line.  
🤔 Maybe there's a useful notion of opposite (probably several) for a topic.  
🔁 But ask for the opposite twice and you get back to where you started.  
🧭 That wasn't very adventurous.  
  
### ❓ Oblique Relationships 🧐  
❓ How do I ask for a topic that's obliquely related?  
🤔 Maybe I can ask for 2 topics that are different, and collectively form a set of 3 distinct topics with the original. Kinda like forming a triangle instead of a line.  
⚠️ But then maybe we'll tend to get 2 relatively arbitrary topics that happen to not intersect the first.  
🤖 And perhaps we'll get monotonous results, where the bots will tend to prefer picking the same arbitrary others.  
🤝 Can I somehow relate those other topics to the first and to each other?  
  
❓ Recommend 2 books that obliquely relate to this book in different ways?  
  
🔄 I could also try asking for the opposite of the opposite. In this case, opposite isn't so well defined, so we may not get back to the original topic. A bit of noise may propagate and push us to new territory.  
  
🧪 I'll have to experiment.  
  
### 🧠 Relevant Disciplines 📚  
  
🧠 I wonder if there's a well studied discipline that can help here. Maybe topology. Or [Linguistics](../topics/linguistics.md). Or literature. Or search? Optimization maybe. Stochastic something or other? Knowledge representation? Graph traversal? AI? Maybe the Dewey Decimal system could help define a space to explore. Information architecture?  
  
🚀 More to explore. Adventures abound.  
  
⏸️ For now I pause.  
  
## 🔍 Broken Dates 📅  
- 📅 The date at the top of each of my web pages has always been the last time I published *any* web page.  
- 🐛 Not the worst bug in the world, but it's a bit annoying.  
- 🔎 Also, I noticed that Google hasn't been indexing recently published pages very quickly.  
    - 📊 Currently, I have 248 pages indexed and 144 not indexed.  
    - 📉 Of those 144, 124 of them are `Discovered - currently not indexed`.  
    - 🤔 Which (I believe) means they haven't crawled them yet.  
    - 📈 But (according to the search console's crawl stats report) they've been crawling my site about a hundred times per day this month.  
    - 🔄 The purpose of those crawls is 98% refresh and 2% discovery.  
    - 💡 Hypothesis: if Google thinks every one of my web pages needs to be updated every time they crawl my site, they'll waste a lot of time crawling pages that haven't changed, and they'll have less crawl budget to spend on a first crawl for newly discovered pages.  
    - ❓ I don't know if this is true, but I expect to find out if it helped in a few days or so, because...  
- 🛠️ ...I fixed it.  
  
## ⚙️ Attempted Fixes 🛠️  
- 🔄 First I tried updating Quartz to the latest version.  
    - 🚧 But that's not super easy to do.  
    - 📂 Updating is done via Git and all the files are kept in my repo.  
    - 🤯 Since I've changed a few things (and don't remember exactly what) it's kind difficult to tell what my changes were if I were to just update to the latest version of everything.  
    - 🚫 So I didn't update everything.  
- 🧐 But I did look at the updated `quartz.config.ts` file.  
  
### 🛠️ The Fix  
1.  📄 [I added `git` to the CreatedModifiedDate plugin's `priority` list](https://github.com/bagrounds/obsidian-github-publisher-sync/commit/7e3ef8b65742e39c3dc7d43fa74638e97ccabd3d) 🚀  
2.  🔄 [I updated quartz/plugins/transformers/lastmod.ts to the latest version](https://github.com/bagrounds/obsidian-github-publisher-sync/commit/c3433bc6bd324f0ae6c65d9a6daf01dbdcc0f8ea) ✨  
3.  🤖 [I (had copilot) ensure `git` is available at build time](https://github.com/bagrounds/obsidian-github-publisher-sync/commit/b0ed0a5f5a3c777f165967e9b70cfe56d99a960b) 💻  
4.  ⚙️ [And I set the `defaultDateType` to "modified" in quartz.config.ts](https://github.com/bagrounds/obsidian-github-publisher-sync/commit/a60c0e87d7be89b8eaaed0b8102ca94b78a4753d) 📅
