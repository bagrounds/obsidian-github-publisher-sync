# Software Engineering  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
**High-Level Summary:**  
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, and retirement of software. It's about creating reliable, efficient, and maintainable software systems that solve real-world problems. The goal is to produce high-quality software within budget and on time, while managing complexity and ensuring robustness. 🛠️✨  
  
**Subcategories:**  
Here are the major subcategories, including Computer Science as a foundational element:  
  
* **[Computer Science](./computer-science.md):**  
    * The theoretical foundation of software engineering. It encompasses the study of algorithms, data structures, computation theory, and programming languages. It provides the underlying principles that software engineers use to design and build software. 🧠💻  
* **Requirements Engineering:**  
    * Focuses on defining, documenting, and managing the needs of users and stakeholders. It's about understanding what the software should do. 📝🔍  
* **Software Design:**  
    * Involves creating the blueprint of the software, including its architecture, components, and interfaces. It's about planning how the software will be built. 🏗️📐  
* **Software Development/Coding:**  
    * The actual process of writing the code that implements the design. This involves choosing programming languages, tools, and frameworks. 💻⌨️  
* **[Software Testing and Quality Assurance](./software-testing-and-quality-assurance.md) (QA):**  
    * Ensuring that the software meets its requirements and is free of defects. This includes various testing techniques, like unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. 🐞✔️  
* **Software Maintenance:**  
    * Modifying and updating software after it has been delivered to correct errors, improve performance, or adapt to new requirements. 🔧🔄  
* **Software Project Management:**  
    * Planning, organizing, and controlling software development projects to ensure they are completed successfully. This includes managing schedules, budgets, and resources. 📅💰  
* **DevOps (Development and Operations):**  
    * A set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. ☁️🚀  
  
**Book Recommendations:**  
Here are some influential and accessible books that provide a solid foundation in Software Engineering and related computer science concepts:  
  
1.  **"Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin:**  
    * This book focuses on writing readable and maintainable code, emphasizing principles and practices that lead to high-quality software. It's a must-read for any developer. 📚✨  
2.  **"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (The "Gang of Four" or GoF):**  
    * A classic in software design, this book introduces fundamental design patterns that can be applied to solve common software design problems. It’s a very valuable tool. 🧩💡  
3.  **"The Pragmatic Programmer: Your Journey To Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition" by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt:**  
    * This book offers practical advice and tips for software developers, covering a wide range of topics from coding to project management. It emphasizes pragmatism and craftsmanship. 🛠️📖  
4.  **"Software Engineering" by Ian Sommerville:**  
    * This book is a comprehensive introduction to software engineering, covering all aspects of the software development lifecycle. It's widely used in academic settings. 🎓📘  
5.  **"Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein:**  
    * This book is a very commonly used book in computer science studies, and covers the fundamentals of algorithms, a key component of computer science, and therefore highly relevant to software engineering. 🤓💡

## Interviewing  
The focus of software engineering interviews is the coding problem.  
Solve a programming problem in front of the interviewer within some time limit.  
This is a skill that needs to be developed independently of every day job skills in order to perform well.  
So what's involved in solving a programming problem and how do we get better at it?  
  
### 1. Reading and understanding the problem  
If you're a slow reader, you'll pay a tax here.  
But it's critical to understand the problem before starting to solve it.  
How can we get better at reading and understanding problems?  
  
### 2. Planning a solution  
1. Brain storm  
2. Consider the trade-offs  
3. Choose an approach  
  
### 3. Implementing a solution  
1. Assume the existence of well-defined helper functions  
2. Write the solution in terms of the helpers  
3. Implement the helper functions  
  1. If we run out of time here, at least the interviewer knows where we were going  
  2. And assuming the helper functions are less complex than the main function, we've at least demonstrated ability on the more challenging part of the problem  
    
#### Optimizations  
The more familiar we are with our chosen programming language, the less time we'll spend translating ideas into working code.  
  
### 4. Troubleshooting  
If bugs are identified, either by executing the code or as pointed out by the interviewer, we'll need to troubleshoot.  
How can we efficiently & effectively troubleshoot our code?  
In the worst case, we have no ability to execute our code, much less instrument it with logging statements.  
We might revert to building a table of variables and manually executing the code with example inputs in order to find the problems.
