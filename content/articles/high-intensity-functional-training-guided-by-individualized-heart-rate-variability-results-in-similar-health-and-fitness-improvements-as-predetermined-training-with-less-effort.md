## 🤖 AI Summary  
The study compares high-intensity functional training (HIFT) guided by individualized heart rate variability (HRV) to predetermined HIFT on cardiovascular function, body composition, and performance. 🏃‍♀️  
  
The following issues were covered:  
* 🫀 All participants significantly improved resting heart rate, lean mass, fat mass, strength, and work capacity.  
* 🏋️‍♀️ No significant differences were observed between the groups for changes in cardiovascular function, body composition, or fitness.  
* 📉 The HRV-guided group trained significantly fewer days at high intensity compared to the predetermined group.  
* 👍 HIFT is a valid program structure for improving muscular strength.  
* 📱 A commercially available smartphone application can be an effective tool for modulating the individual prescription of exercise intensity.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
This study contrasts with some previous research by showing no significant difference in fitness improvements between the HRV-guided and predetermined training groups. 🤸‍♂️ Past aerobic exercise investigations also found that HRV-guided groups had increases in aerobic capacity with no significant difference between groups. The finding that HRV-guided training did not lead to greater changes in strength is similar to a previous study that used HRV to augment training frequency instead of intensity. The paper suggests that HRV may be a practical tool to individualize the prescription of training frequency and intensity. 🧠 Future investigations should explore the application of this intervention across different experience classifications of HIFT participants to determine the cause of strength gains. 🧐 It would be beneficial to quantify the total work completed by each group to provide additional support for the reduced training load of the HRV-guided group.
