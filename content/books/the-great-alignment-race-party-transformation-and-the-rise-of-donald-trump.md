# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🐘⬆️ The Great Alignment: Race, Party Transformation, and the Rise of Donald Trump  
  
📊↔️🇺🇸 America's profound political polarization and Donald Trump's rise are rooted in a long-term societal alignment of racial, ideological, religious, and geographic divides, exacerbated by negative partisanship and white racial resentment, rather than solely economic grievances.  
  
## 🏆 Alan I. Abramowitz's The Great Alignment: Race, Party Transformation, and the Rise of Donald Trump Summary Strategy  
  
### 🌳 The Great Alignment: Core Concepts  
* 🇺🇸 **Deep Societal Divisions:** US political divide reflects long-standing racial, ethnic, religious, ideological, and geographic splits.  
* ⏳ **New Deal Coalition Breakup:** Historical context for partisan realignment, dating back to the 1950s-1980s.  
* 😠 **Negative Partisanship:** Voting based on hostility toward the opposing party, a crucial factor in election outcomes, including Trump's victory.  
* 😟 **Racial Anxiety/Resentment:** Statistically, a better predictor of support for Donald Trump than economic discontent.  
* 👥 **Polarization is Mass-Based:** Divides are not confined to political elites; they reflect a deeply polarized public.  
  
### 📈 Trump's Rise: Explanations  
* 💥 **Exploitation of Divides:** Trump capitalized on existing fear and hatred of Democrats, unifying Republican identifiers.  
* 🗳️ **White Voter Support:** Includes educated white voters expressing deep pessimism linked to changing demographics and values.  
* 💰 **Economic Grievances:** Closely connected to racial and ethnic resentment among Trump supporters.  
  
## ⚖️ Critical Evaluation  
* 📊 Abramowitz effectively uses copious survey research and statistical analysis to support his claim that political polarization is deeply rooted in American society and not merely an elite phenomenon.  
* 🔑 The argument that racial anxiety is a stronger predictor of Trump support than economic discontent is a central and well-supported claim, drawing on extensive data.  
* 🤔 Some critics, like those reviewing the book for the Claremont Review of Books, acknowledge the portrait of continuity but suggest Abramowitz may uncritically accept the idea that ideological polarization is disproportionately found among Republicans.  
* 🆚 The book directly contrasts with perspectives like Morris Fiorina's, which argue polarization is primarily an elite phenomenon, by providing data on increasing ideological polarization of ordinary voters.  
* 🗣️ While Abramowitz emphasizes the divisive and dark message, some analyses of Trump voters suggest an element of optimism and a desire for a better life, a better town, a better country among his supporters, beyond just anger.  
* 🤝 The book's analysis of negative partisanship as a key driver of modern elections, promoting party loyalty and straight-ticket voting, is widely acknowledged in political science literature.  
* ✅ Final Verdict: Abramowitz provides a robust, data-driven argument that American political polarization, fueled by racial resentment and negative partisanship, is a profound societal characteristic, not just an elite-driven dynamic, offering a compelling explanation for the rise of Donald Trump.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
### 💡 Q: What is negative partisanship?

### 💡 Q: How does race play a role in The Great Alignment?  
✅ A: Abramowitz argues that racial and ethnic divides are central to the great alignment, deeply polarizing the public. He finds that racial anxiety is a significantly stronger predictor of support for Donald Trump than economic factors.  
  
### 💡 Q: Did economic anxiety contribute to Donald Trump's rise?  
✅ A: While economic grievances exist, Abramowitz's statistical analysis suggests that among Trump supporters, these grievances are more closely linked to racial and ethnic resentment than to objective economic conditions, with racial anxiety being a better predictor of support.  
  
### 💡 Q: Is political polarization a phenomenon limited to political elites, or does it extend to the general public?
