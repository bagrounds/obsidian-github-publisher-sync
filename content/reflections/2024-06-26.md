### [545. Boundary of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/boundary-of-binary-tree)  
> The **boundary** of a binary tree is the concatenation of the **root**, the **left boundary**, the **leaves** ordered from left-to-right, and the **reverse order** of the **right boundary**.  
> The **left boundary** is the set of nodes defined by the following:  
> - The root node's left child is in the left boundary. If the root does not have a left child, then the left boundary is **empty**.  
> - If a node in the left boundary and has a left child, then the left child is in the left boundary.  
> - If a node is in the left boundary, has **no** left child, but has a right child, then the right child is in the left boundary.  
> - The leftmost leaf is **not** in the left boundary.  
> The **right boundary** is similar to the **left boundary**, except it is the right side of the root's right subtree. Again, the leaf is **not** part of the **right boundary**, and the **right boundary** is empty if the root does not have a right child.  
> The **leaves** are nodes that do not have any children. For this problem, the root is **not** a leaf.  
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the values of its **boundary**_.  
  
#### 🪞 Reflections  
1. 52 minutes is a long time  
    1. 8:20 is too long for planning  
    2. finishing the first implementation in ~12 minutes isn't bad, but there were a couple of bugs  
    3. testing took a long time, but it found several bugs  
    4. But this is a pretty complicate problem, so maybe it's not too bad  
2. I'm happy with the bugs I caught during manual testing  
3. The bug I didn't catch during manual testing was a careless mistake  
    1. I didn't think about ordering the nodes properly on my first pass of the high-level implementation  
    2. and I didn't notice that my test result was not what it should have been (in terms of the order of nodes) at the end of testing  
    3. but I was able to recognize the issue immediately and fixed it in one shot  
4. I'm happy with my recursive implementations  
5. I feel like working with trees is getting more natural  
  
#### ⌨️ My Solutions  
```ts  
/* Return the values of the boundary of the tree  
Boundary =  
1. root  
2. left boundary (left subtree of root + leftmost, non-leaf nodes in left subtree)  
3. leaves  
4. right boundary (analogous to left boundary)  
  
Approaches:  
1. walk the tree 3 times to get the left boundary, right boundary, and leaves - O(N)  
2. walk the tree once, pushing elements into either left boundary, right boundary, or leaf arrays - O(N)  
  
Approach 1 is a bit slower due to multiple passes, but it may be simpler code, thus better in an interview context.  
[8:20] Done planning  
[20:58] Done with initial implementation  
Bugs found during manual testing:  
1. left boundary: including inner right nodes  
[31:01] done fixing leftBoundary  
2. leafNodes: error detecting root node  
[37:17] done fixing leafNodes  
[44:57] done with test  
Bugs found during null checks  
1. pushed node instead of node.val into nodes array in leafNodes function  
[48:20] done fixing leafNodes  
[49:05] first automated test  
Wrong Answer: [1,null,2,3,4] -> [1,2,3,4] (expected [1,3,4,2])  
Ah.. correct nodes, wrong order  
[52:30] Fixed  
[52:37] Successful submission
