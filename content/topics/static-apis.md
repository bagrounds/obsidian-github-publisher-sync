# Static Apis  
Under certain circumstances, it can be beneficial to replace servers hosting a web API with a pre-generated set of data hosted as static files.  
I've seen this idea bare fruit at work in the past and I'm about to apply the trick again in a new context.  
Does this pattern have a name?  
I'd like to reference some literature on the topic while planning this project but I'm struggling to find much source material.  
After a few searches, groping in the dark for key words, I came across the term _static API_. This is an apt label for the pattern, but the sparsity of search results has me wondering if there's a more common name for this pattern.
