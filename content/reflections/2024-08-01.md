## 🏋 Coding Practice  
  
### [112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum)  
> Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.  
> A **leaf** is a node with no children.  
  
#### 🪞 Reflections  
1. Never great to get a wrong submission  
    1. This was due to a misunderstanding of the problem.  
    2. A careless mistake - I should read the description more carefully.  
    3. My initial implementation did what I wanted it to - just not what the problem was looking for.  
    4. This highlights the importance of asking clarifying questions during a real interview  
2. Finding my way back to a working solution in under 25 minutes isn't terrible  
3. The initial implementation came out quickly and without much waffling or difficulty  
4. Manual testing  
    1. I added the null-checks as I wrote the initial code, which feels more efficient than coming back afterword  
    2. while my tree notation for test values isn't hyper-efficient, it's much easier to work with than the super efficient, but easy to misread list annotation used in LeetCode examples (e.g. `[1,2,3,null]`  
    3. Testing the recursive implementation felt natural and effective  
5. All in all, a nice warm up for my real interview later today  
    1. I intentionally chose an `Easy` LeetCode problem just to warm up my usual routine without inducing too much stress by struggling with a more challenging problem on the day of an interview.  
  
#### ⌨️ My Solution  
```ts  
/* Determine if a root-to-leaf path summing to target exists  
Thoughts  
1. In the worst case, we have to traverse the entire tree  
2. But there's a lot of overlap in the paths  
3. Depth first search seems appropriate so we can stop as soon as we get a match  
4. Trees are recursive data structures - a recursive algorithm feels appropriate  
  
Plan:  
1. Implement a recursive depth first search  
  2. maintain a path-prefix sum until reaching each leaf  
  3. return the OR (lazily if possible) of the boolean response of each child  
  4. micro-optimization: if there are no negative values, we could abandon a sub-tree when we surpass the target  
    - note: negative values are possible, so we can't abandon early  
  
[4:20] Done planning  
[9:16] Done with initial implementation  
[15:04] Done with test  
[16:05] Initial Submission  
Bug found after submission  
1. Wrong Answer -> [], 0 (expected false, yielded true)  
  - Okay, I guess the empty sum in this case isn't zero; should have been a clarifying question  
[18:30] fixed above  
[18:45] Next submission  
Bug found after submission:  
1. Wrong Answer -> [1,2], 1 (expected false, yielded true)  
  - Ah - language from the description: "A leaf is a node with no children"  
  - so don't follow paths to the null  
[24:40] Successful submission  
Oh yeah, this is linear (O(N)) in runtime and extra space complexity
