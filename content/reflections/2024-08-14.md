### [28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string)  
> Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.  
  
#### 🪞 Reflections  
1. After reviewing the official solutions, it was a good idea to go with brute force.  
    1. Arguably, I should have reached this conclusion sooner.  
2. Testing  
    1. During manual testing, I found and fixed several indexing errors  
    2. However, the one blunder stayed: continue where break was intended  
        1. A silly mistake  
        2. one that I recognized not too long after a failed submission  
3. This feels like a good warm up for my interview later today  
    1. Not too stressful  
    2. Gets me coding and re-familiarizes me with my process  
  
#### ⌨️ My Solution  
```ts  
/* Find index of first occurrence of needle in haystack  
1. Brute force:  
  - scan left to right  
  - upon finding first index, check subsequent indices for a match  
runtime complexity: O(N^2)  
extra space complexity: O(1)  
inefficiency lies in the fact that we may scan the same substrings repeatedly  
  
Can we pre-scan to avoid repetition?  
How do we remember where legitimate candidates exist?  
[9:29] let's just brute force it first  
[13:06] done with initial implementation  
[17:07] Finished test; first submission  
bugs found after first submission:  
1. Wrong Answer: leetcode, leeto (1 != -1)  
2. whoops: break instead of continuing  
[18:43] Successful submission

function strStr1(haystack: string, needle: string): number { // sasadb, sad  
  for (let i = 0; i < haystack.length; i++) { // 2; 1; 0  
    for (let j = 0; j < needle.length; j++) { // 2; 1; 0; 2; 1; 0  
      if (haystack[i + j] !== needle[j]) break // T; T; T; F; F; T; T  
      if (j === needle.length - 1) return i // T => return 2  
    }  
  }  
  return -1  
};  
  
// let's just use the built-in indexOf  
function strStr(haystack: string, needle: string): number {  
  return haystack.indexOf(needle)  
};  
```
