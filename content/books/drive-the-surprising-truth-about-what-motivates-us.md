### Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us 🚗  
**TL;DR:** Intrinsic motivation, driven by autonomy, mastery, and purpose, significantly outperforms extrinsic motivation (rewards and punishments) for complex, creative, and long-term tasks.  
  
**A New or Surprising Perspective 🤯:** Daniel Pink challenges the traditional "carrot and stick" approach to motivation, arguing that it's often counterproductive in the modern workplace and for tasks requiring cognitive skill.
