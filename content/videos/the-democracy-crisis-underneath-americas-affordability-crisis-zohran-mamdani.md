## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
🗽 The Democracy Crisis Underneath America’s Affordability Crisis  
  
* 🗣️ Democracy is lost when it cannot demonstrate relevance to the day-to-day material struggles of working people \[[01:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=96)].  
* 🏙️ There is an ever-widening chasm between the difficulty New Yorkers face in affording the city they love and their ability to belong to that city's democracy \[[01:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=108)].  
* 👂 We grounded the campaign in listening to New Yorkers, taking a different approach from consultant-advised polling \[[03:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=185)].  
* 🏠 Our campaign focused on three central ideas: freezing the rent for over 2 million rent-stabilized tenants \[[03:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=192)], 🚌 making the slowest buses in America fast and free \[[03:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=203)], and 🧸 delivering universal child care \[[03:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=207)].  
* 💰 Costs like the $2.90 public transit fare are out of reach for one in five New Yorkers \[[04:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=256)].  
* 🛑 People lose faith when their lives remain the same regardless of who is elected, showing a need to extend democracy beyond the ballot box \[[06:35](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=395)], \[[06:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=401)].  
* 📚 Our platform reaches back to a populist progressive alliance, reflecting a legacy of leaders like Fiorello LaGuardia and Al Smith \[[08:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=511)], \[[09:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=545)].  
* 🛠️ We will build a team characterized by the work they have done, not the people they know \[[12:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=775)].  
* 💡 The objective is to change the culture of no within city government to a culture of how, embracing ambition and imagination \[[14:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=864)], \[[14:51](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=891)].  
* ⚖️ The city must utilize existing tools and laws, recognizing the great forgetting of the power government already possesses \[[13:31](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=811)], \[[15:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=915)].  
* 💸 There is an $800 million lack of political will, as the city has failed to collect this amount in fees from bad landlords \[[16:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=981)].  
* 💼 The city must fully fund agencies and fill 17,000 vacant city jobs; the issue is the lack of interest from City Hall in hiring, not a lack of interest from New Yorkers \[[17:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=1028)], \[[17:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEkx7D87hg4&t=1042)].

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### ❓ Q: Why is the cost-of-living crisis a crisis of democracy?  
* 🗽 A: The crisis of democracy stems from the political system's failure to address the daily material needs of working people. 💰 When high costs push people out of the city or force them into survival mode, they lose a sense of agency and belonging, believing their political engagement is meaningless because their lives never improve, ultimately undermining faith in government.  
  
### 🏘️ Q: What specific policies are central to Mayor-Elect Mamdani's affordability agenda?  
* ✅ A: The affordability agenda focuses on three key areas: a rent freeze for rent-stabilized tenants, fast and fare-free city buses for all residents, and the implementation of universal child care to significantly reduce family expenses.  
  
### ⚙️ Q: How will the new Mayor-Elect ensure city government is more effective and delivers on its promises?  
* 🏛️ A: The plan involves changing the government's operational culture from no to how and restoring its authority. 📚 This includes utilizing and fully enforcing existing laws and regulations that have been neglected, such as collecting $800 million in outstanding fines from bad landlords. 🧑‍💼 It also requires fully funding city agencies and filling over 17,000 vacant civil service positions.
