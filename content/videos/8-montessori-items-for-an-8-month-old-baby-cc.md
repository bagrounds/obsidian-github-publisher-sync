* 🚫 **Restraint:** Provide **space** and **time** for free exploration without adult restraint or expectation.  
* 🧘 **Hold Back:** Believe in their ability to solve their own frustration; don't intervene immediately.

## 🤔 Evaluation  
🍎 The **Montessori approach** contrasts sharply with traditional, adult-centric parenting methods which often involve high chairs, cribs, and structured, toy-chest-based play that limits a child's **freedom of movement** and **self-reliance**. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Other child development philosophies, such as **Reggio Emilia**, share the respect for the child's potential but emphasize the environment (the "third teacher") and community collaboration more than the specific, simplified material presentation of Montessori.  
  
💸 Further exploration should address the **cost barrier** of purchasing specialized Montessori furniture and materials versus **DIY solutions**. 🗺️ Identifying how **cultural parenting norms** might influence the adoption and success of practices like early toilet orientation and floor beds would provide a richer context. 🧩 Investigating the **transition** from the Montessori home environment to conventional preschools or schools is key for long-term implementation.
