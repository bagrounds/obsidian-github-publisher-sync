# 🤖🗣️🤝 Stanford Seminar - Beyond «Bots and Trolls» - Understanding Disinformation as Collaborative Work  
![Stanford Seminar - Beyond «Bots and Trolls» - Understanding Disinformation as Collaborative Work](https://youtu.be/SvEItxWb6Ek)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* 🇺🇸 The 2016 US presidential election was the first high-profile case of social media being weaponized by a foreign power to influence a democratic process \[[00:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=37)].  
* 🇷🇺 Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA), a troll farm, deployed thousands of fake social media accounts across Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram \[[00:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=54)].  
* 🎯 The core objective was to sow discord and exploit existing social and political divisions, not necessarily to promote one candidate \[[01:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=70)].  
* 👥 The IRA created hundreds of themed pages, such as for the Black Lives Matter movement and pro-veteran groups, to target vulnerable communities and generate distrust \[[01:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=85)].  
* 💰 Campaigns used targeted ads, paid for in rubles, and orchestrated real-life events, protests, and rallies to bring online conflict into the physical world \[[01:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=93)].  
* 💡 The fundamental problem is social media platform design, which prioritizes engagement and virality, making them ideal vectors for disinformation \[[02:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=150)].  
* ⚔️ Disinformation campaigns continue to target elections globally, with methods adopted by domestic groups, creating a disinformation arms race \[[02:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=138)].  
* 🛡️ Combating this requires a society-wide effort, focusing on media literacy and stronger platform accountability \[[02:59](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvEItxWb6Ek&t=179)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* ✅ The video's claim of Russia's interference in the 2016 election to sow discord is strongly corroborated by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's report Russian Active Measures Campaigns and Interference in the 2016 U.S. Election and the Mueller Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election.  
* ⚖️ While the video emphasizes foreign interference, the Georgia Institute of Technology's study The Role of the Crowd in Countering Misinformation shows that ordinary citizens, the crowd, generate 96% of refuting arguments to misinformation, indicating counter-disinformation is largely a civilian effort.  
* 🧩 The video focuses on the **supply-side** issue of actors and platform design, but the **Carnegie Endowment for International Peace** in Countering Disinformation Effectively: An Evidence-Based Policy Guide argues that disinformation is also driven by **demand-side** psychological needs that make people receptive to false narratives.  
* 🔎 **Topics to explore for a better understanding:** The efficacy of platform algorithmic adjustments versus school media literacy programs. The long-term impact of generative AI and deep-fake technology on information credibility. The growing threat posed by domestic misinformation campaigns compared to foreign operations.
