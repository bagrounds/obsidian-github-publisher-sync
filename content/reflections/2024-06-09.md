## ☕ Motivation  
- [How to hack your brain to crave doing hard things.](../videos/how-to-hack-your-brain-to-crave-doing-hard-things.md)  
  
## 🏋 Practice  
Today I want to try a new planning strategy.  
The plan is to  
1. Paraphrase the question  
2. Consider any clarifying questions  
3. Identify the primary algorithm or technique that will drive my solution  
- This primary algorithm or technique should  
  - be recognizable to another engineer (e.g. an interviewer)  
  - support runtime complexity analysis  
4. Write down the expected run-time complexity  
5. Stop planning and move on to coding  
The goal is to dramatically speed up my planning process.  
If I'm aiming to solve a problem in 15 minutes, I should aim to be done planning in 2 minutes.  
  
### The Problem  
[974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k)  
> Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return _the number of non-empty **subarrays** that have a sum divisible by_ `k`.  
> A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.  
  
### 🪞 Reflections  
1. It's frustrating to not find the optimal solution, but I think I did the right thing during planning. I observed that this was an O(N^2) algorithm, it probably wouldn't be fast enough, but I couldn't come up with a better solution in a reasonable amount of time. This is the best I can do in this scenario during an interview.  
2. I forgot to check the clock after planning, so I'm not sure if I hit my 2 minute mark or not. I suspect probably not, as it took a bit of time to think of a solution.  
3. But - getting a working (though not fast enough) solution in under 19 minutes is still pretty good.  
4. I'm not sure if this is a good sign or a bad sign, but even after reading through [the optimal solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/solution) a few times, I find it nearly incomprehensible. Either this is a new trick I need to learn or it's obscure and hopefully not critical to understand.  
  
### My Solutions  
```ts  
/* return non-empty subarrays with sum divisible by k  
- subarray implies contiguity  
- zero is divisible by k  
- -k is divisible by k  
  
- 2 pointers might work, but I'd need to reset the forward pointer multiple times  
- maybe dynamic programming. If [i...j] is divisible by k and [j+1...l] is divisible by k, then [i...l] is divisible by k  
- 2 pointers seems more tractable in short time. let's try that  
- O(N^2)  
  
[16:00] done with implementation and 1 test  
bugs after local test:  
1. can't find names i & j (changed variable names)  
2. any[] is not assignable to type 'number'  
3. tried returning the array, not its length (originally misread problem)  
4. cannot assign to a constant (let vs const)  
[18:24] first submission after local tests pass  
time limit exceeded  
This solution probably works, but O(N^2) is too big  
I'll probably need a dynamic programming solution to get it in time

[20:00] plan dynamic programming solution  
okay, what are the sub problems?  
each individual element is a sub-array that can be combined with its neighbors  
if we try a bottoms-up approach, we can  
- start by computing all length-1 subarrays  
- then move on to length-2 subarrays, using previously calculated sums  
- continue in this fashion until we're asking if the entire array is divisible by k  
- it feels like there's some recursion here, starting with the length-1 and moving up  
- we can implement dynamic programming by caching results for recursive calls  
- let's try it  
- runtime O(N + N/2 + N/3 + ... + 1) = O(N * (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/N))  
- I don't honestly know exactly what this series converges to, but it grows slowly  
- what is it for N=8?  
- = ((8 * (1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8)))  
- = ((8 * (1 + 9/20 + 15/56)))  
- = ((8 * (1 + 27/60 + 15/56)))  
- = ((8 * (1 + 27/60 + < 15/60)))  
- = (8 * (1 + < 42/60)) < 8 * (1 7/10)  
log_2 8 = 3 => n * log(n) shouldb e 8 * 3, we have less than that here, so maybe this is roughly logarithmic or less  
~ O(N*log(N))  
* wow, that runtime analysis took way too long and probably isn't right

[1:00:40] whew... changed direction during implmentation, done with first pass

bugs found  
1. cache type (boolean -> number)  
2. typo in recursive call function name

timeout  
... yeah, this is still N^2  
it's actually O(N + (N - 1) + (N - 2) + ... + 1) which is ~O(N^2)  
My analysis above was wrong.  
[1:20:21] okay, I can't think of a faster solution right now. Time to quit.

## 🏋️ Another Mock Interview!  
A friend offered to give me a mock interview today.  
This was a great session and I got some good feedback.  
After our session, I wrote up a couple of solutions to the problem in a [git repo](https://gitlab.com/bagrounds/interview-prep/-/blob/main/src/run-length-encoded-dot-product.ts).  
  
### 🪞 Reflections  
1. Overall, the session went pretty well.  
2. I did get bogged down managing state during code implementation, which is an area to continue to focus on improving.  
3. I think he had a great tip for me here. **When struggling to get the details right, it can be helpful to write out an example input (in a comment) and manually work through the algorithm.** After writing it out, it should be easier to reference in code. I'll need to practice this.  
4. Whoops, I implemented a small helper function before the main function. He mentioned that I should avoid that, and I'd already come to this conclusion previously.  
5. Time management.  
- Don't implement helper functions unless the interviewer asks for them.  
- He said I did a great job of communicating and narrating my thought process, but I can afford to be less verbose. It's okay to mention that I need to think for a bit, silently mull over the problem for 15 seconds, then continue on with my conclusions.  
- It's best to not have to change approaches mid problem.
