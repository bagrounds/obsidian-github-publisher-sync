## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
⚖️ Yellow gas billowed through the shattered maternity ward window, stinging Mary’s raw throat. 🏛️ A doctor slammed his shoulder against the door, screaming about sterile fields before a gloved hand shoved him back. 🧠 The agent didn't look at the carnage; he looked at his watch, checking the timestamp for his dual-report. 🌊 He snatched the slippery, wailing infant from the nurse’s trembling arms. ☄️ Separate intake codes flashed on his tablet—one for the mother, a different, distant one for the asset. 📜 Mary lunged from the bed, her fingers clawing at the agent’s tactical vest as the stitches tore. 📺 Outside, the news van cameras remained blinded by the chemical fog, filming nothing but the white-out.
