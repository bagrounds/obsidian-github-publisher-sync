# [🧠🤖📈 Scientists just developed a new AI modeled on the human brain — it's outperforming LLMs like ChatGPT at reasoning tasks](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/scientists-just-developed-an-ai-modeled-on-the-human-brain-and-its-outperforming-llms-like-chatgpt-at-reasoning-tasks)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
🧠 A new AI model, the **hierarchical reasoning model (HRM)**, has been developed to mimic the human brain's 🧠 processing.  
* 📈 The model 🤖 consists of a high-level module for slow, abstract planning and a low-level module for rapid, detailed computations.  
* 💯 HRM's performance on the **ARC-AGI-1 benchmark** was 40.3%, outperforming OpenAI's o3-mini-high (34.5%) and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 (21.2%).  
* 🚀 It also showed near-perfect performance on complex tasks like **Sudoku** and maze navigation.  
* 📉 The model is more efficient, requiring only **27 million parameters** and 1,000 training examples compared to the billions of parameters in large language models.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
The ⚖️ HRM presents a compelling alternative to current **large language models (LLMs)**. While LLMs excel at generating text and general knowledge tasks through massive data consumption, HRM demonstrates that a different architectural approach, inspired by **cognitive science**, can lead to superior performance on specific, logic-based reasoning tasks. This highlights a fundamental difference in how these models "think." The HRM's efficiency and reasoning ability suggest that future AI development may not be solely a race for more parameters but could also involve more sophisticated, brain-inspired architectures. 🤔 Further topics to explore include how to scale this hierarchical approach to handle the massive datasets LLMs use, and whether a hybrid model could combine the strengths of both approaches.  
  
## 📚 Book Recommendations  
  
### 🧠 Similar  
  
- 🧠 **Livewired** by David Eagleman: This book explores the brain's 🧠 constant state of change and adaptability, which offers a great parallel to the new, adaptable AI models being developed.  
  
- **[🧠🧠🧠🧠 A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence](../books/a-thousand-brains.md)** by Jeff Hawkins: This book proposes that intelligence comes from the brain building a predictive "world model," a view highly relevant to the new AI model's hierarchical design.  
  
- **[🧠🔄🏆 The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science](../books/the-brain-that-changes-itself.md)** by Norman Doidge: It provides a fascinating look into the concept of **neuroplasticity**, showing how the brain can rewire itself. This directly relates to the idea of creating AI models that can adapt and "learn" in new, dynamic ways.  
  
### ⚖️ Contrasting  
  
- **The Master Algorithm** by Pedro Domingos: This book compares and contrasts the five major schools of machine learning, giving a broad perspective on different AI approaches and their fundamental differences.  
  
- **An Artificial History of Natural Intelligence: Thinking with Machines from Descartes to the Digital Age** by David W. Bates: This book offers a philosophical and historical perspective, arguing that our understanding of the human mind is shaped by the machines we create.  
  
- **The Emperor's New Mind** by Roger Penrose: A classic in the field, this book argues that human consciousness cannot be replicated by any known computer algorithm, providing a stark contrast to the claims of brain-like AI.  
  
### ✨ Creatively Related  
  
- **The Alignment Problem** by Brian Christian: This book tackles the critical question of ensuring AI's goals align with human values, a vital topic as these models become more capable and integrated into society.  
  
- **[🌊🤖🤔 The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the 21st Century's Greatest Dilemma](../books/the-coming-wave-technology-power-and-the-21st-centurys-greatest-dilemma.md)** by Mustafa Suleyman: An insider's look at the immense power and societal risks of AI, this book puts new model developments into a real-world, geopolitical context.
