# [🏛️🔍❌🗳️ Analysis: Heritage Foundation’s Database Undermines Claims of Recent Voter Fraud](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/analysis-heritage-foundations-database-undermines-claims-recent-voter)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* 🗳️ The database, used to support claims of widespread voter fraud, actually **undermines** them, confirming fraud is **vanishingly rare**.  
* 📉 Claims of almost 1,100 proven instances are **grossly exaggerated** and **lack context**, pulling cases from decades past, like 1948 and 1972.  
* 👤 Across billions of votes, only **10 cases** of in-person impersonation fraud at the polls were identified in the document.  
* 👽 Just **41 cases** of non-citizens registering, voting, or attempting to vote were found over five decades, disproving claims of millions of illegal non-citizen votes.  
* 🛑 The vast majority of cited fraud examples **would not be fixed** by the restrictive voting laws championed by the database's proponents.  
* 🛡️ Many cases highlight that **existing laws and safeguards are already effective**, as the ineligible voters or misconduct were successfully discovered and stopped.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* ⚖️ The analysis is strongly supported by consistent findings from reliable, nonpartisan sources.  
* 🎯 The **Brookings Institution** corroborates the rarity of fraud, noting that in Pennsylvania, only 39 cases were found across 30 years and over 100 million ballots, with none altering an election outcome (Brookings Institution, How widespread is election fraud in the United States? Not very).  
* 📚 Similarly, research published in the **Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences** and by **The University of Chicago** found **no evidence for systematic voter fraud** in the 2020 election, negating major statistical claims.  
* 🧠 Further understanding requires exploring: the distinction between **voter fraud and election misconduct**; the **political motives and effect of restrictive voting laws**; and the **historical use of fraud claims** to justify voter suppression.
