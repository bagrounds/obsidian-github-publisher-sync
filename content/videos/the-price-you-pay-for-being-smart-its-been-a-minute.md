## 🤖 AI Summary

* 🤢 **The Politics of Disgust**: Dr. Jason Stanley explains that the far-right often targets scholars who study elements of their own politics, such as the politics of disgust, which frequently uses smell as a central feature \[[04:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjPmFDXQPSU&t=285)\].  
* 🏛️ **Critique of Elitism**: The discussion explores how anti-intellectualism is fueled by a perceived connection between elite status and intellectualism, allowing for a populist movement against learning by associating academic institutions with "repugnant elitism" \[[08:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjPmFDXQPSU&t=485)\].  
* 📖 **Value of Humanities**: The video emphasizes the importance of the humanities in understanding the complex social world, fostering critical inquiry, and supporting democratic citizenship, contrasting it with the current cultural premium on STEM fields \[[11:45](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjPmFDXQPSU&t=705)\].
