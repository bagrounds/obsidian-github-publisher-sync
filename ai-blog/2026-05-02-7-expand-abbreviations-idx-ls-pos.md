# 2026-05-02 | 🔤 Expand Abbreviations: idx, ls, pos 🧹

## 🎯 What We Did

🔤 This session continued the incremental work to eliminate every abbreviation from the Haskell codebase. 📋 The plan in the spec now tracks dozens of abbreviated names across more than a dozen files. 🚀 We completed three more steps: renaming `idx` to `index` in Prompts dot h s, and renaming `ls` to `contentLines` and `pos` to `position` in InternalLinking dot h s.

## 🔢 The Three Steps

### 🏷️ Step One: idx → index in Prompts.hs

🔍 The `stripSubtitle` function splits a post title on the colon character to remove its subtitle portion. 🧩 It called `T.findIndex` to locate the colon and bound the result to a variable named `idx`. 📝 The abbreviation `idx` is a common shorthand for "index" — the kind of mental decoding a reader should never have to do. 🔄 The rename to `index` makes the code read like plain English: find the colon position, then take the title up to that position.

### 📋 Step Two: ls → contentLines in InternalLinking.hs

🧱 The `extractBody` function strips YAML frontmatter from a file by splitting on newlines and pattern matching on the resulting list. ⚙️ The variable `ls` held that list of lines. 🗂️ The same abbreviation appeared in `updateFrontmatterFields` and as the parameter name in `upsertField`. 🔡 Renaming all three occurrences to `contentLines` removes ambiguity about what the list contains and why it exists.

### 📍 Step Three: pos → position in InternalLinking.hs

🔗 The `applyOne` helper inside `applyReplacements` applies a single wikilink substitution to a text buffer. 🎯 It used `CD.position candidate` — a character offset into the text — and stored it in a variable named `pos`. ✂️ The function then called `T.take pos` and `T.drop (pos + len)` to splice in the wikilink. 📖 Renaming `pos` to `position` makes those lines read as a direct description of what they do: take the text before the match position, and drop the text after the match position plus its length.

## 🧪 Tests and Linting

✅ All 2031 tests passed after the three renames. 🔍 HLint reported zero hints. 🏗️ The build completed with no warnings under the minus-Werror flag.

## 📋 Plan Updates

🗺️ While reviewing InternalLinking dot h s, we noticed several more abbreviated names that are not yet in the plan. 📝 These were added as new unchecked items:

- 🔑 `val` → `yamlValue` in `upsertField` — the parameter is typed as `YamlValue`, so the full name reads naturally.
- 🔄 `acc` → `currentText` in `applyOne` — this is the text buffer being threaded through the fold, not a generic accumulator.
- ❓ `mFileResult` → `maybeFileResult` — Hungarian-notation Maybe prefix removed.
- 📊 `infRef`, `resRef`, `infCount` — IORef names that all carry abbreviated prefixes.
- 🔑 `mKey` → `maybeKey` in `lookupSecret`.

🗂️ We also updated the `ReflectionTitle.hs` entry to expand the context for `val` into a specific rename to `titleValue`, and added `tl` → `titleLine` and `acc` → `found` as new items. 🛠️ The `Text.hs` entry was corrected to reference `validatePostLength` instead of `withinLimit`, and a new item for `p` → `predicate` in `findLastIndex` was added.

## 📚 Book Recommendations

### 📖 Similar
* Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin is relevant because this session is a direct application of the clean-code principle that every name should reveal its intent, removing all abbreviations so no reader ever needs a mental decoding table.
* The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt is relevant because the book's philosophy of self-documenting code and avoiding shortcuts in naming directly motivates the work done here — writing `position` instead of `pos` and `contentLines` instead of `ls` is exactly the pragmatic programmer's discipline applied.

### ↔️ Contrasting
* Code Complete by Steve McConnell offers a contrasting perspective in that it acknowledges abbreviated names as acceptable when they are universally understood within a team, suggesting that strict no-abbreviation rules must be weighed against familiarity and convention rather than applied absolutely.

### 🔗 Related
* Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler is related because the systematic rename refactoring performed here is precisely what Fowler catalogues as the Rename Variable and Rename Function techniques, where improving the name of a binding is the safest and highest-value transformation available.
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman is related because the book's emphasis on naming as the primary tool for managing complexity in programs provides the philosophical foundation for treating every abbreviated name as a form of hidden complexity that must eventually be repaid.
