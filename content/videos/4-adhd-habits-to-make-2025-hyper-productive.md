## 🤖 AI Summary  
🎬 This video by Ali Alqaraghuli, PhD, 🧠 details four habits designed to significantly 🚀 boost productivity, especially for individuals with 🧠 ADHD. 👨‍💼 He shares personal strategies he employs across his 💼 full-time job, 🏢 part-time business, and 📺 YouTube channel.  
  
Here are the specific habits covered:  
* 🗓️ **Look at your Calendar as Much as Possible**: ⏳ This habit addresses "time blindness" common in ADHD. 🗣️ The speaker recommends keeping a 🗓️ calendar constantly open, either on a 🖥️ dedicated monitor or as a 🏠 default screen, and using the 📝 integrated task list within 🗓️ Google Calendar to schedule tasks directly, fostering ⏰ urgency and better ⏰ time awareness.  
* 😴 **Control Your Sleep Pattern**: 💡 The core idea is to go to 😴 sleep and wake up 🌅 earlier. 🌡️ The speaker's specific trick involves programming a ⚙️ thermostat to drop to 🥶 66 degrees Fahrenheit around 🌙 11 PM to induce sleepiness and rise to 🌞 72 degrees Fahrenheit around ⏰ 8:30 AM for a natural wake-up without an 🚨 alarm, noting that 🥶 colder temperatures improve sleep quality.  
* 🚀 **Embrace "Vzero" Thinking (Action Produces Information)**: 💡 Inspired by Brian Armstrong, this habit encourages taking an 👣 initial step ("Version Zero") even without a clear, 💯 perfect plan. 🧠 For ADHD individuals who struggle with starting due to a need for clarity and fear of wasted energy, this approach helps, as taking action produces information that guides subsequent steps, reducing overthinking and perfectionism.  
* 🎯 **Switch from Long-Term to Short-Term Thinking**: 🧭 While long-term goals provide direction, this habit emphasizes that 🧠 ADHD individuals are often more motivated by short-term rewards and immediate feedback. 🗣️ The speaker suggests using both external (e.g., a 🍬 treat) and internal (e.g., feeling good 😊) short-term rewards to make initiating tasks "second nature," rather than solely relying on distant long-term visions.  
  
🗣️ The speaker highlights that these habits, particularly short-term thinking, are more effective for individuals higher on the 🧠 ADHD spectrum.
