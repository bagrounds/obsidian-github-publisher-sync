# [🗣️🧠🧑‍💻📚 Relating Natural Language Aptitude to Individual Differences in Learning Programming Languages](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60661-8)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
- 💡 The experiment tested the hypothesis that learning modern programming languages, like Python, resembles learning a second **natural language** in adulthood.  
  
- 🧠 Predictors included **behavioral** (language aptitude, numeracy, fluid cognition) and **neural** (resting-state EEG) indices of language aptitude.  
  
- 📏 Outcome measures for the $36$ participants who completed ten $45$-minute Python training sessions were **rate of learning**, **programming accuracy**, and **post-test declarative knowledge**.  
  
- 📈 Resulting models explained **$50-72\%$ of the variance** in learning outcomes.  
  
- 📊 Across outcomes, **fluid reasoning and working-memory capacity** explained the most variance ($34\%$), followed by **language aptitude** ($17\%$), **resting-state EEG power** ($10\%$), and **numeracy** ($2\%$).  
  
- 💪 General cognitive abilities (fluid reasoning and working memory factors) were the **best average predictors** of programming outcomes, accounting for nearly $34\%$ of the variance.  
  
- 🗣️ Language aptitude measures explained **significant unique variance** in each outcome, competing well with other factors.  
  
- ✨ Language aptitude was the **strongest predictor of learning rate**, explaining $43.1\%$ of the variance in the best-fitting stepwise regression model.  
  
- 🎯 Fluid intelligence was the **strongest predictor of programming accuracy** ($50.1\%$ explained) and **declarative knowledge** ($30.9\%$ explained).  
  
- 🔢 Numeracy was a reliable but minor predictor, explaining an average of only **$2\%$ of the variance** across outcomes.  
  
- ⚡ Resting-state EEG power in beta and low-gamma frequency bands over the **right fronto-temporal networks** predicted unique variance in Python learning rate and declarative knowledge, explaining $10\%$ of the variance on average.  
  
- 🖼️ The findings suggest a new framework for programming aptitude, indicating that **numeracy's importance may be overestimated** in modern programming education.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
- 📚 This study offers **novel evidence** of a strong relationship between **natural language aptitude** and learning a modern programming language like Python.  
  
- 💡 The finding that **numeracy's predictive utility** is low compared to language aptitude and general cognition **challenges commonly held ideas** and prerequisites in computer science education.  
  
- 🌐 The use of **fluid reasoning** and **working memory** as strong predictors aligns with existing literature on complex skill learning and classic information processing models of programming.  
  
- 🧠 A **unique contribution** is the inclusion of **neurocognitive measures** like resting-state EEG, which provided the first evidence of neural correlates of programming aptitude.  
  
- 🧐 Topics for better understanding include **determining the extent to which these results translate to less user-friendly languages** such as Java, which are more widely used in professional software engineering.  
  
- ⚙️ Further investigation is also needed to solidify the speculative connection between **resting-state beta power** and the ability to acquire and apply statistical knowledge from sequential information.  
  
- 🎓 Research should explore if these findings apply to **higher programming proficiency levels** beyond a beginner course.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 💻 Q: What cognitive abilities best predict success in learning the Python programming language?  
  
- 🧠 A: The cognitive abilities that best predict success in learning Python are **fluid reasoning** and **working memory**, followed by **natural language aptitude**. Fluid reasoning was the strongest overall predictor for programming accuracy and declarative knowledge, while language aptitude was the strongest predictor for the rate of learning.  
  
### 🔢 Q: Is mathematical skill or numeracy a critical factor for programming aptitude?  
  
- 📉 A: **Numeracy** was found to be a **reliable but minor predictor** of programming aptitude in this study. It accounted for only an average of **$2\%$ of the variance** across learning outcomes and was far from the most significant factor, suggesting its importance may be **overestimated** in modern programming education.  
  
### 💬 Q: How is natural language learning aptitude related to learning programming?  
  
- 🔗 A: **Natural language aptitude** is a **robust predictor** of all Python learning outcomes (learning rate, programming accuracy, and declarative knowledge). The study's central hypothesis is that learning modern programming languages **resembles second natural language learning** in adulthood, due to programming languages being designed to resemble the communication structure of human languages.  
  
### 💡 Q: What neural (brain) characteristics predict programming aptitude?  
  
- ⚡ A: **Resting-state EEG power** in the **beta** ($13-29.5$ Hz) and **low-gamma** ($30-40$ Hz) frequency ranges, recorded over the **right fronto-temporal networks**, predicted unique variance in the rate of Python learning and declarative knowledge, respectively. This provides the first evidence of **neural correlates** for programming aptitude.
