# This Single Rule Underpins All Of Physics  
![This Single Rule Underpins All Of Physics](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs)  
### TL;DR 🎬  
This video explains the principle of least action in physics, from its historical roots in the problems of fastest descent and Fermat's principle, to its modern formulation and broad applications, unifying classical mechanics and hinting at its relevance in quantum theory.  
  
### The Problem of Fastest Descent 🎢  
* [00:00:55](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) The video introduces the question of the fastest path for a sliding object between two points.  
* [00:09:41](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) The solution, discovered by Johan Bernoulli, is the cycloid curve, not a straight line. 🤯  
  
### Fermat's Principle of Least Time ⏱️  
* [00:05:36](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) Bernoulli was inspired by light's behavior, which, according to Pierre Fermat, follows the path of least time. 💡  
  
### Maupertuis and the Concept of Action ⚛️  
* [00:11:07](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) Pierre Louis Maupertuis proposed that nature minimizes "action" (mass x velocity x distance) rather than time.  
* [00:12:35](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) This idea was initially met with ridicule. 😂  
  
### Euler and Lagrange's Contributions ➕  
* [00:13:59](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) Leonard Euler refined Maupertuis's principle.  
* [00:16:31](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) Joseph Louis Lagrange provided a general proof, establishing the principle of least action as a fundamental law. 💯  
  
### Modern Formulation and Hamilton's Principle ⚡  
* [00:22:08](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) The principle is now expressed using kinetic and potential energy, integrated over time; this is known as Hamilton's principle. ⚙️  
  
### Applications and Implications 🔭  
* [00:26:19](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) The principle unifies various fields of physics.  
* [00:27:40](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) It simplifies complex physics problems. 💪  
  
### Beyond Classical Mechanics ✨  
* [00:30:16](https://youtu.be/Q10_srZ-pbs) The video hints at the principle's importance in quantum theory, a topic for a future video. 🔮
