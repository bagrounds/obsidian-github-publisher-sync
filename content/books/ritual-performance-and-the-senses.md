* 🧍 It centralizes the body and the 🖐️ experiential, 👃 sensory nature of 🎭 ritual practices.  
* 🧠 The book integrates perspectives from cognitive/neuroanthropology, 🎭 performance studies, and the anthropology of the 👃 senses.

* 🧠 **Cognitive Processes:** Explores the relationship between 🎭 ritual actions, 🧠 brain function, and cognitive processes, including concepts like the "extended sensorium" where cognition intersects brain, body, and environment.  
* 🎭 **Performance and 🗺️ Space:** Examines how 🎭 ritual performances shape and are shaped by 🗺️ space, particularly in contexts like pilgrimages.  
* 🌍 **Transmission of Culture:** Offers a nuanced understanding of how cultural and 🙏 religious knowledge is transmitted and shared not just intellectually, but through embodied, 👃 sensory experience.  
  
### 🏗️ Structure/Contributions  
  
* 📖 The book features eight chapters by 👨‍🏫 scholars from the contributing fields.  
* 🤔 Topics range from philosophical discussions of 🧠 belief to explorations of neurological processes during 🎭 ritual.

### ⚖️ Contrasting Perspectives  
  
* 📖 **McLaren, Peter. *Schooling as a 🎭 Ritual 🎬 Performance: Towards a Political Economy of Educational Symbols and Gestures***: While focused on schooling, it analyzes 🎭 ritual 🎬 performance through a critical, political economy lens, contrasting with the more cognitive/experiential focus.
