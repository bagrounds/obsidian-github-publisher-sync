# 2025-01-12 | 💬 Chat Docs 📄  
## 🔱 Domination  
- I wrote a script to call a locally running ollama server and generate harder comments for each file in a [side project](https://gitlab.com/bagrounds/purescript-wip/-/compare/master...20-generate-broad-documentation-with-ai).  
  - I can't run big models on my Chromebook... No GPU. But I can run llama3.2:3b.  
  - I tried to ask vscode's copilot extension to generate header comments for every file without one. It writes great comments, but would only write maybe 5-10 at a time. So it's a bit tedious.  
  - writing my own script allows me all the automation and scale I need  
    - but I'd either need an API token, which I believe requires a paid account for any of the cloud providers  
    - or I get to us the best model my Chromebook can run on 12 CPU cores and 14G of RAM  
    - With the smaller model, I've found I need to be more careful with my prompts.  
      - ask small, simple, narrow questions  
      - and still watch it sometimes ignore explicit instructions...  
    - but it's progress, and I'm having fun with it.  
      - and it's pretty awesome to leave my laptop on to write for me while I sleep  
- one of the prompts that was only sometimes obeyed: write a 1-line description of this code (then insert the code)  
  - most of the time, it would obey, but sometimes it would write a ton  
  - I noticed that this happened with larger files  
  - it made me think 🤔 maybe by the time it's done reading all the code, it's "forgotten" the original prompt.  
  - experiment: add the prompt after the code in addition to before it to see if that helps it follow the guidelines.  
  - early results: 🎉 it's worked for at least one of the problem cases! I'll let it write overnight and see how well it performed on the rest later.  
  - 💬🔧 I believe this is called prompt engineering.
