# Digital Twin  
## An Operational Definition  
Digital twin - a digital representation of the recent state of a subject; a means of observation  
  
```mermaid  
graph LR  
R[üïë Subject] -->|üåê| D[2Ô∏è‚É£ Digital Twin]  
```  
  
## Essentials  
1. A subject to observe  
2. A sensor to measure the subject  
3. A means of capturing sensor measurements in a digital form  
4. A data schema to represent the measured state  
5. Transmission of measurements to storage  
6. Digital storage for the state of the subject  
  
```mermaid  
graph  
S[üå°Ô∏è Subject]  
M[üëÅÔ∏è Sensor]  
X[üíæ Storage]  
M -->|üìè Measure| S  
M -->|üì∑ Capture\n‚û°Ô∏è Convert\nüì° Transmit| X  
```  
  
## Why?  
üëÅÔ∏è Observe -> üßë‚Äçüî¨ Experiment -> üß† Understand -> üîÆ Predict -> üí≠ Simulate -> üó∫Ô∏è Plan -> üéÆ Control  
  
## Extensions  
- saving multiple states with timestamps yields a historical record for study  
- synthesizing and filtering multiple measurements allows for error correction and improved accuracy  
- mathematical models allow simulation and prediction  
- frequent updates allow for rapid response to real-time events and high fidelity historical records  
- digital twins with networked effector interfaces allow closed loop control systems to be built  
  
## Examples  
- ‚åö Smartwatches  
  - measure physiology, movement, and position  
  - to understand and improve behavior and health  
- üì¶ shipment tracking  
  - measures the position of packages  
  - to understand and improve delivery performance  
- ‚úàÔ∏è instrumented machines  
  - measure operating parameters  
  - to understand and improve performance and maintenance  
- üåê instrumented software systems  
  - measure resources, performance, and usage metrics  
  - to understand and improve product performance, operations, and maintenance
