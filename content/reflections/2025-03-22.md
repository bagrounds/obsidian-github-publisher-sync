# 2025-03-22 | 🪞 Reflecting | 🚀 Exploring  
## 🤔 Titles are hard...  
... but they can also be fun 🥳.  
💎 I made a [Gemini](../software/gemini.md) Gem to help out.  
  
### ✒️ Title Craft  
> Help me come up with a concise, catchy title for the following.  
> First, come up with broad categories that fit the content.  
> Continue to combine the categories until they no longer overlap.  
> Then, come up with single word for each category that combined make a concise, catchy title.  
> Finally, choose one emoji for each word.  
> Format the result as follows:  
> Emoji1 Category1 | Emoji2 Category2 | ...  
> Or use a short title with emojis  
> Present many options. Then present some more. Inject a lot of variety and explain the rationale.  
  
📜 I have 127 old posts to title.

## 🪞🕸️🪵 Reflecting on Reflections  
🗓️ It's almost been a year since I started blogging 🤯.  
[2024-04-19 | 👋 Hello, World! 🌎](./2024-04-19.md)  
🧮 This is my 128th daily reflection 🪞.  
🎲 Well... not all of them are very reflective.  
Sometimes this feels more like a log 🪵.  
A log 🪵 on the web 🕸️.  
A 🕸️🪵 weblog  
A blog 🌐.  
👌 And that's okay.  
  
## 🔬 Tiny  
🎯 My goal was to make it very easy to blog.  
✅ That way I'd be more likely to do it.  
🤏 A [Tiny Habit](../books/tiny-habits.md).  
It's been very easy.  
I write from my phone.  
I've made templates.  
I've automated.  
  
I've recently started generating content with AI tools.  
I'd been accumulating more empty posts for books than I was comfortable with.  
This site exists to serve as a reference for myself and others.  
I read a lot of good books and want to share my notes.  
But it's easier to read than it is to write.  
Especially when reading audiobooks 😁.  
So I've read a lot more books than I've written notes on.  
A blank page isn't very valuable.  
And a few fragmented sentences on a fragment of the content are not much better.  
AI tools can generate a book report nearly instantly.  
It's not my writing. It's not perfect. But it's better than nothing.  
And with some iterative prompt engineering, I'm pretty happy with the quality of book reports I'm generating.  
Not perfect, but valuable.  
  
And networked.  
Generating a book report with book recommendations is a great way to explore.  
I ask for books that relate in a variety of ways in order to cover more ground.  
It's fun to think of prompts that increase variety and breath in recommendations.  
How do you explore a space relative to a starting point you can't see yet?  
  
Generic relationships for blind book exploration  
- similar  
- opposite  
- more general  
- more specific  
- more rigorous  
- more accessible  
- fictional  
  
## Multidimensional exploration  
What dimensions meaningfully characterize books?  
Maybe I can find some more.  
- Rigor vs Accessibility  
- Generality vs Specificity  
- Popularity vs Obscurity  
  
It's easy to explore along these 1-dimensional scales.  
  
It's hard to explore categorical spaces.  
I can ask for a book on an opposing topic.  
But topics don't live on a line.  
Maybe there's a useful notion of opposite (probably several) for a topic.  
But ask for the opposite twice and you get back to where you started.  
That wasn't very adventurous.  
  
How do I ask for a topic that's obliquely related?  
🤔 Maybe I can ask for 2 topics that are different, and collectively form a set of 3 distinct topics with the original.  
Kinda like forming a triangle instead of a line.  
But then maybe we'll tend to get 2 relatively arbitrary topics that happen to not intersect the first.  
And perhaps we'll get monotonous results, where the bots will tend to prefer picking the same arbitrary others.  
Can I somehow relate those other topics to the first and to each other?  
  
Recommend 2 books that obliquely relate to this book in different ways?  
  
I could also try asking for the opposite of the opposite. In this case, opposite isn't so well defined, so we may not get back to the original topic. A bit of noise may propagate and push us to new territory.  
  
I'll have to experiment.  
  
I wonder if there's a well studied discipline that can help here. Maybe topology. Or [Linguistics](../topics/linguistics.md). Or literature. Or search? Optimization maybe. Stochastic something or other? Knowledge representation? Graph traversal? AI? Maybe the Dewey Decimal system could help define a space to explore. Information architecture?  
  
More to explore. Adventures abound.  
  
⏸️ For now I pause.
