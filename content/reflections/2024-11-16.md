# 2024-11-16 | 🤔 Qualities 👥  
## 🤔 What's the most valuable quality a person can have?  
- Intelligence is nice  
  - but it doesn't get things done on its own  
  - and difference can breed violence. Too much intelligence can lead to bullying, for example.  
- kindness is nice  
  - literally  
  - and it tends to be infectious, which is even better  
  - but its value is still context dependent  
    - all the kindness in the world may not help during a mugging  
- flexibility  
  - is useful in many contexts  
  - but it's passive  
- adaptability  
  - seems like flexibility with an active component  
  - it is the trait that chases survival in evolution  
  - but is survival all we can hope for?  
- creativity  
  - allows us to do more than adapt to our environment  
  - we can envision a better world and work to create it  
  - but many creative individuals working on their own may have different visions, which may produce conflict  
- collaborativity  
  - resolves the potential conflict when multiple people create  
  - but building together doesn't necessarily mean building good things together  
- leadership  
  - is like guiding a collaborative effort  
  - but how do you ensure you're leading in a good direction?  
  
It feels like these qualities may combine to form a lattice...

🤔 Is there a word for wise, benevolent leadership?
