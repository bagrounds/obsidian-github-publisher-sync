# 🇺🇸🗣️💡🗓️ A Presidential Platform for Americans 2028  
  
## 📢 The Opportunity  
- 👹 Donald Trump has taught us that  
    - 🇺🇸 Americans want change  
    - 🏛️ Presidents wield immense power  
- 💥 As his abuses of power flood the country with violence and corruption, the rising American will for positive change presents a unique opportunity to elect a leader to wield this immense power for good.  
- 🙏 We need a wise, benevolent leader to work for the people with every available tool.  
  
## ⚖️ Principles

## ✅ Priorities  
1. 🚫 End poverty  
2. 🇺🇸 Strengthen democracy  
    1. 📚 Educate  
    2. 🗳️ Empower and expand civic participation  
    3. 📢 Fight disinformation  
  
## 💡 Ideas  
  
### 💼 The Job Guarantee  
- 🚀 Effective immediately, the federal government guarantees a job to anyone willing to work.  
    - 📉 Involuntary unemployment goes to zero.  
    - 💪 Millions of workers mobilize to improve the nation.  
- 🇺🇸 Make America Great.  
    - 🥇 We will finally step into our oft purported role as the greatest nation on earth by offering the best guaranteed benefits in the world.  
- ⚖️ The wages and benefits of the job guarantee immediately become a minimum bar to employing people in America by forcing private businesses to compete with new minimum standards without the need for explicit laws or regulations.  
    - ✅ The benefits  
        - 🍔 Food  
        - 🏠 Housing  
        - 🎓 Education

    - 🗳️ Implement community led public works projects  
  
### 📱 Public Tech  
#### 🌐 Social Media  
- 👎 Private social media companies sold out the American people.  
- 🚫 There's no reason to continue to allow Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Donald Trump to amass obscene personal wealth by empowering foreign governments, wealthy elites, and ideological zealots to spread propaganda and lies over today's most prevalent mass communication platforms.  
- 💻 Social media technology is easy to build and maintain.  
- 📢 A public social media platform will  
    - 🆓 be free  
    - 🆔 tie participation to government verified identity  
    - 🚫 not sell advertising  
    - 🔬 support, direct, and leverage research on algorithms that improve social cohesion rather than inspiring hate and division  
    - 💻 build free and open source software in the public domain  
    - 👁️ operate transparently  
    - 🗳️ self govern, democratically  
  
#### 🚗 Gig Platform  
- 🚫 We need not allow Uber, et. al. to siphon wealth from workers and consumers on every transaction made on the only viable gig work platforms.  
- 📢 A public gig work platform will  
    - 🏛️ allow the federal government to subsidize labor that supports public service goals, such as childcare and education  
    - 💰 allow workers to keep 100% of their earned revenue  
  
#### 📚 Digital Library  
- 🔎 Identify the best educational materials: books, audio, videos, games, etc  
- 🤝 Buy the rights from authors as necessary to put them in the public domain  
- 🆓 Offer them for free, without limits, to all Americans via a public digital distribution platform  
- ✍️ Allow content creators to publish new material for sale on the platform  
    - ✅ As new material breaches a popularity threshold and passes a quality audit, buy the rights from the author, move it into the public domain, and remove the cost of access  
  
### 📊 Patriot Metrics  
- 💰 Today we measure, mandate, and reward the hoarding of private profits and generate massive inequality.  
- ⚖️ In order to balance the scales, let's begin by measuring patriotism.  
- 🇺🇸 Patriot metrics measure the degree to which businesses improve the lives of their employees, customers, and communities.  
- 🚀 Patriot metrics can drive change by  
    - 📢 spreading awareness, which allows individuals to support patriotic businesses and pressure greedy businesses to change  
    - 🏛️ enabling tax policies that incentivize patriotism  
    - 🔎 allowing for the study, identification, and regulation of extremely unpatriotic practices  
- ✅ Examples  
    - 💰 Measure the Geni coefficient across every employee of a business to see how well thry distribute wealth internally  
    - 📈 Measure the change of wealth distribution over time of a business' owners, customers, and surrounding communities to yield insights into exploitative pricing, lasting product and service value, and community impact  
  
### 🍎 Food Security  
- 💸 Money doesn't grow on trees, but food does.  
- 🤝 Give people SNAP benefits; feed them for a political cycle. 🌱 Invest in sustainable micro-agriculture, community gardens, and efficient food supply, distribution, and composting infrastructure and education; feed them for generations.  
  
### 🏘️ Housing for All  
- 🏗️ Build housing. Lots of it. Everywhere.  
- 🚫 Ban corporate ownership of housing.  
- 🏦 Tax land to disincentivize hoarding and inefficient use.
