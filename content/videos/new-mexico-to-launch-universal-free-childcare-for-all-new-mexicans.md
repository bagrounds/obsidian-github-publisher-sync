# 👶🧑‍👩‍👧‍👦💲➡️ New Mexico to launch universal free childcare for all New Mexicans

## 🤖 AI Summary  
The 📺 video covers New Mexico's new initiative to provide 🤝 free, universal child care. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham provides insights on the program, and its expected impact.  
  
* 💰 Families are expected to save an average of $12,000 per child each year \[[00:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ36QhD3fN0&t=16)].  
* 📈 This initiative will boost the state's economy by increasing the workforce and supporting the growth of new businesses in the early childhood and child care sectors \[[01:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ36QhD3fN0&t=82)].  
* 🛢️ Funding for the program comes from a trust fund with revenues from oil and gas taxes and a land grant permanent fund \[[02:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ36QhD3fN0&t=127)]. The state was able to implement this while also lowering personal income and gross receipts taxes \[[03:26](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ36QhD3fN0&t=206)].  
* 🌍 The universal program ensures that everyone has access, and New Mexico is working to guarantee that even the most vulnerable families, including those in high-poverty areas, can access these services \[[04:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ36QhD3fN0&t=245)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
The video presents the program as a  blueprints for America, but other perspectives offer a more cautious view. 🔎 Research on universal child care programs in other places, such as Quebec, Canada, has shown mixed results. Some studies indicate that while such programs can increase maternal employment, they can also have negative long-term impacts on children’s social and emotional development. The debate often centers on whether a universal approach is the most efficient way to address child care affordability, as some critics argue that a targeted, voucher-based system would better serve the most vulnerable families without providing subsidies to wealthier ones. 💰 A deeper understanding would require an examination of long-term studies on child development outcomes and a comparison of different funding models (e.g., trust funds, taxes) to evaluate financial sustainability.
