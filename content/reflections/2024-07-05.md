## 🏋 Coding Practice  
[Yesterday](./2024-07-04.md), I failed to implement a working solution for this LeetCode problem.  
It's time for round 2.  
  
### [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree)  
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).  
  
#### 🪞 Reflections  
1. 🎉 Success!  
2. Previously, I'd tried to avoid reflection & equality checking because it seemed kinda wasteful and clunky. That was a mistake. Whatever seems most obviously correct should probably be the first choice to implement during an interview.  
3. < 16 minutes is pretty good.  
4. Manual testing is tedious sometimes, and annotating tree state for recursive functions is even more tedious and can be error prone.  
  
#### ⌨️ My Solution  
```ts  
/* Plan:  
1. reflect the tree  
2. check if the tree is equal to its reflection  
runtime complexity: O(N)  
extra space complexity: O(N)  
[0:36] Done planning  
[6:37] Done with initial implementation  
[12:54] finished manual test of recursive reflection function  
thought I found a bug, but then realized I'd actually just misinterpreted my own tree annotation  
[15:16] partially tested equal function  
no bugs found  
[15:47] successful submission
