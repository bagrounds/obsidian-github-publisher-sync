## 🏋 Coding Practice  
[Previously](./2024-07-05.md), I solved the [LeetCode 101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree).  
On [my first attempt](./2024-07-04.md), I actually failed to solve the problem, attempting an approach that didn't work out.  
Last time, I did implement a working solution, but it felt like more work than was necessary.  
Today, I looked up [the official solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/solution), and see that they demonstrate a recursive approach that I hadn't identified.  
I find this approach interesting, because their `isMirror` function is nearly identical to the `equal` function I implemented as a helper in my working solution.  
I struggled to find a recursive solution that directly solves the problem because I wasn't able to see how we could keep track of both sides of the tree independently as we recursively descend.  
I see that they solved this by creating an `isMirror` function that takes **2 trees**, and descends each one recursively.
