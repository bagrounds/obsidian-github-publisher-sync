### 🏆 Tamanaha's On the Rule of Law: History, Politics, Theory Cheat Sheet  
  
#### 🧠 Core Philosophy  
  
* ⚖️ Rule of Law: Foremost political ideal, yet widely confused.  
* 🧩 Conceptualization: A "family of doctrines," not a monolithic concept.  
* 🔑 Essence: Government officials and citizens bound by and abide by law.  
* 🎯 Purpose: Channels, constrains, informs power; prevents arbitrary exercise of power.  
* ❗ Distinction: Core Rule of Law differs from democracy or human rights.  
* 🌎 Universality: A universal human good, with diverse manifestations globally.  
  
#### 🧱 Key Elements of Formal Legality (Thin Rule of Law)  
  
* **👑 Law's Supremacy**  
    * 🏛️ Government limited by law; all subject to same laws.  
    * 🚫 No one above the law.  
* **📜 Characteristics of Laws**  
    * 📅 Set forth in advance; publicly promulgated.  
    * 🌐 General, not particularized.  
    * ➡️ Prospective (non-retroactive).  
    * ✅ Clear, comprehensible.  
    * ⏳ Relatively stable.  
    * ❌ Non-contradictory.  
    * 💪 Possible to perform/obey.  
* **🛡️ Institutional Safeguards**  
    * ⚖️ Equality before the law: Applied equally.  
    * 👨‍⚖️ Independent judiciary: Impartial courts, effective judicial protection.  
    * 🤝 Accountability: Government and private entities accountable to laws.  
    * 🏛️ Separation of powers.  
    * 🚫 Arbitrary power exercise.  
    * 🔎 Procedural transparency: Law-making process.  
  
#### 💭 Theoretical Streams  
  
* **📐 Formal Theories**  
    * 🎯 Focus: Form and procedures of law.  
    * 💡 Emphasis: Predictability, legal certainty.  
    * 🤔 Critiques: Can be morally neutral; may serve illiberal regimes.  
* **🌟 Substantive Theories**  
    * 🎯 Focus: Incorporates moral content (e.g., human rights, justice, democracy).  
    * 👨‍🏫 Tamanaha's view: These are desirable, but distinct from the core definition of Rule of Law.  
  
#### 🕰️ Historical & Political Context  
  
* 🏛️ Origins: Classical Greek, Roman, medieval contributions.  
* 🌍 Modern Relevance: Central to liberal theory and political systems.  
* 🗣️ Contemporary Debates: Concerns about decline from conservatives; critiques from radical Left.  
* 🌱 Global Impact: Widely promoted ideal for development, often with limited success.
