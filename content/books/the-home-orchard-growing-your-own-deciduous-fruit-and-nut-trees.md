* **[🏡🍎 The Backyard Orchardist: A Complete Guide to Growing Fruit Trees in the Home Garden](./the-backyard-orchardist-a-complete-guide-to-growing-fruit-trees-in-the-home-garden.md) by Stella Otto:** ℹ️ An expanded and updated guide that is also full of facts and handy tips. 📅 It includes a detailed seasonal almanac, though it's more of a one-size-fits-all for the continental US as the author is based in Michigan. 🍎 It features a helpful quick-reference chart for fruit varieties.  
* 🌿 **The Holistic Orchard: Tree Fruits and Berries the Biological Way by Michael Phillips:** 🌳 This book offers a different perspective, focusing on biological methods. ❄️ While useful, its advice may be more tailored to colder climates like northern New Hampshire, which could be irrelevant or misleading for growers in warmer regions like Southern California.  
  
### 🛠️ Focused on Specific Orchard Practices  
  
* 🌱 **Grow a Little Fruit Tree by Ann Ralph:** 🌳 This book is excellent for those wanting to grow fruit trees on a smaller scale from the beginning. 🌍 It covers selecting varieties, planting sites, and the needs of various stone and pome fruits, figs, persimmons, feijoas, and pomegranates (excluding citrus, avocados, or exotics).  
* ✂️ **How to Prune Fruit Trees by R. Sanford Martin (Walter Anderson Nursery edition):** 🌳 A superb pocket reference specifically for pruning. 📍 It covers site selection, planting, and pruning tips for a wide range of temperate zone fruit trees, berries, grapes, walnuts, almonds, and pecans. 🥑 Notably, it also includes avocados. 🏡 Newer editions have added content on backyard orchard culture.  
  
### 📍 Regionally Focused (Consider for your specific area if not California)  
ℹ️ While "The Home Orchard" is California-centric, it's a good reminder to seek out local cooperative extension publications or experienced local growers in your specific region for the most tailored advice on variety selection, pest control, and timing.
