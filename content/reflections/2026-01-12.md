## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
📂 The archive’s seal was initially cracked by a secret leak. 🏛️ By morning, democracy found itself in an unprecedented cage: it sues the very citizens it once served. 💔 After breaking the news, the city’s collective brain simply stalled. 🔋 A total burnout of the civic soul followed. 👮‍♀️ Policing the fallout became a phantom task as the legal impeachment of the public mind took hold. ⚠️ We were no longer voters; we were threats to our own stability, processed by a machine that had finally learned to fear its own shadow.
