# 🏛️🇺🇸⚖️💔 Former Justice Anthony Kennedy on political division and the state of the Supreme Court  
![Former Justice Anthony Kennedy on political division and the state of the Supreme Court](https://youtu.be/jMneFUWkWJI)  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
* ⚖️ The **swing vote** metaphor is the problem; the cases swing, the Justice does not \[[00:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=23)].  
* ✅ Jurisprudence is quite consistent and it doesn't swing \[[00:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=39)].  
* 💵 Campaign finance cases are *very* difficult \[[01:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=71)].  
* 🛑 It is wrong that the successful candidate is the one who has the most money \[[01:17](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=77)].  
* 📰 The issue in campaign finance was that Congress restricted corporate money but exempted the *New York Times* and the *Washington Post*, which are corporations \[[01:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=89)].  
* 🚫 Upholding the restriction only for big corporations would have led to endless cases on line-drawing \[[01:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=101)].  
* 🗳️ Voters should be better informed about who is giving money, who is getting money, and take that into account when they vote \[[02:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=126)].  
* 🏠 The *Obergefell v. Hodges* opinion passed the **refrigerator test** \[[02:49](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=169)].  
* 📝 This means that certain parts, specifically those about the **dignity and the sanctity of marriage**, were worthy of being taped to a refrigerator for the family to read \[[03:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=202)].  
* 🕰️ The law must stand the test of time \[[03:43](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=223)].  
* 💪 Re-examination and additional conversation about the reasons for decisions are a strength of the system \[[04:15](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=255)].  
* 📉 The greatest threat to the democratic system is a **lack of stability** \[[04:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=276)].  
* 🤝 Democracy requires a rational, thoughtful, probing discussion with respect for the **dignity of the other person** \[[04:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=286)].  
* 💻 The cyber age is problematic because people talk only to those who feel exactly the same way \[[05:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=316)].  
* 🗣️ The internet does not lend itself to debate \[[05:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=350)].  
* ⏳ The court is increasingly reliant on **emergency orders**—or the "shadow docket"—which provides little time for briefs, arguments, or careful thought \[[06:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=407)].  
* 👂 It is very important that the court hear arguments \[[07:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=427)].  
* ⚠️ Courts must be *very* careful about their position when deciding so many critical social issues that the public should be deciding for themselves \[[07:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=450)].  
* 🏛️ The danger of the court being thought of as **partisan and political** is very real and of great concern \[[08:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=504)].  
* 🚨 The danger begins with the **confirmation process**, which is too partisan \[[08:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=513)].  
* 🧠 Emphasize temperament, learning, moderation, and thoughtful writing in judicial appointments over whether a person will decide a case a specific way \[[09:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=547)].  
* 💡 The most meaningful part of the legacy is to **give reasons** for what is done and be unafraid to discuss those reasons openly \[[09:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=582)].  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* ⚖️ The Justice resists the "swing vote" label, arguing his jurisprudence is consistent and driven by the facts and law of the cases \[[00:39](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=39)].  
* 🤝 This self-assessment is partially supported by analysis that identifies a consistent focus on **liberty** and **human dignity** as the core of his legal philosophy, as explored in the book *Justice Kennedy's Jurisprudence* by Frank J. Colucci.  
* 💵 The defense of the *Citizens United* ruling rests on avoiding line-drawing between big and small corporations and relying on voter disclosure \[[01:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=101)], \[[02:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=126)].  
* ❌ This rationale is sharply contrasted by highly reliable, unbiased sources, which document the catastrophic, anti-democratic impact of the decision.  
* 📈 The Brennan Center for Justice and The Roosevelt Institute report that the ruling led to a massive increase in unlimited political spending by corporations and wealthy individuals, often funneled through dark money groups, severely limiting transparency and expanding the potential for political corruption (**Citizens United and the Decline of US Democracy: Assessing the Decision's Impact 15 Years Later** by The Roosevelt Institute).  
* 🚨 The Justice's warning about the "very real" danger of the court being perceived as partisan due to the confirmation process \[[08:24](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=504)], \[[08:33](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=513)] aligns with consensus among legal scholars.  
* 📉 The Brennan Center for Justice, for instance, argues the current Court has deepened a legitimacy crisis through its "pro-partisanship turn" and increased use of the "shadow docket"—the very *emergency orders* the Justice worries about for lacking time for argument \[[06:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=407)] (**A Legitimacy Crisis of the Supreme Court's Own Making** by Brennan Center for Justice).  
  
**Topics to Explore for a Better Understanding:**  
* 🌐 The practical effects of the internet on political discourse: **Barbara Mecham**, a professor from the University of Michigan, is cited as observing that the cyber age leads people to talk only to those who share the same views \[[05:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=347)]. Further research on her work or similar academic studies on echo chambers and polarization would be beneficial.  
* ⭐ The legal concept of **dignity**: Exploring how the Justice developed and applied the concept of human dignity across various opinions, such as in *Obergefell* and in cases related to abortion or detention of combatants, would provide insight into the consistency of his jurisprudence.  
* 📜 The **Shadow Docket**: Investigating the rise of the Supreme Court's use of unexplained, non-argued *emergency orders* and its measurable impact on judicial consistency and public perception of the court's legitimacy.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### Q: ⚖️ Why did former Justice Anthony Kennedy reject being called the "swing vote" on the Supreme Court?  
A: 🔄 Justice Kennedy explained that the term "swing vote" bothered him because it suggests a person moving back and forth \[[00:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=23)]. ✅ He maintained that his jurisprudence was **quite consistent** and did not swing; instead, it was the specific **cases** that would swing \[[00:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=30)]. His decisions flowed from a constant judicial philosophy.  
  
### Q: 💵 What was Justice Kennedy's key concern and rationale in the controversial campaign finance cases, such as *Citizens United*?  
A: 📰 His key concern was the arbitrary line-drawing in the law, which restricted general corporations but **exempted media corporations** like the *New York Times* \[[01:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=89)]. 🏛️ He stated there was "no jurisprudential reason" to draw a line between different types of corporations \[[01:54](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=114)]. 💡 His hope was that greater **voter disclosure** about who is giving and receiving money would allow the public to account for the spending when they cast their votes \[[02:09](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=129)].  
  
### Q: 📉 According to Justice Kennedy, what is the greatest threat to American democracy in the modern age?  
A: 🤝 Justice Kennedy identified a **lack of stability** as the greatest threat \[[04:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=276)]. 🗣️ This instability is exacerbated by the **cyber age**, where people only talk to those who agree with them, preventing the rational, thoughtful, probing discussion necessary for a healthy democracy \[[05:47](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=347)]. 👤 He stressed the need to respect the **dignity of the other person** even during disagreement \[[04:58](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=298)].  
  
### Q: 💍 What is the "refrigerator test" used to describe the power of Justice Kennedy's *Obergefell v. Hodges* opinion?  
A: 🏠 The "refrigerator test" is a personal measure of an opinion's cultural impact and power \[[02:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=176)]. ✍️ It means the written text is so moving and important that parents want the family to read it and will literally **tape it to the refrigerator** \[[03:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=187)]. 💖 In this case, the parts of the *Obergefell* opinion discussing the **dignity and sanctity of marriage** passed the test \[[03:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMneFUWkWJI&t=202)].
