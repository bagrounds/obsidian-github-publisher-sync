> Create a concise, expert-level cheat sheet for The Family Firm: A Data-Driven Guide to Better Decision Making in the Early School Years.  
Extract and distill the core philosophy and most actionable, specific steps into a highly condensed format. Section headings and bulleted lists only - no paragraphs or standalone prose - organized appropriately into major thematic sections.  
STRICT FORMATTING RULES:  
> - Use markdown only.  
> - Title: Use an H3 markdown header (###) for the main title (e.g., "🏆 [Author]'s [Topic] Strategy").  
> - Structure: Use H4 Markdown headers (####) for the major thematic sections. Use nested bullet points for all lists (no horizontal or comma-separated lists).  
> - Lines: DO NOT use horizontal rules (---) or tables.  
> - Brevity: Full sentences are NOT required. Adopt an ultra-concise, Strunk and White-style brevity (e.g., "Protein: 1.6 g/kg min. Muscle preservation."). Do not Use filler or unnecessary language. Edit your own work to achieve ultimate concision. Your goal is to convey maximum insight with as few words as possible.  
> - Completeness: PRIORITIZE COMPLETE LISTS. Only use "etc." or ellipses (...) on their own bullet point when providing a complete list is genuinely impossible or impractical for the cheat sheet's format.
