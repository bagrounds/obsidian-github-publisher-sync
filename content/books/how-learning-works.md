## 🤖 AI Summary  
### TL;DR: How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching Summary 🧠  
Effective teaching hinges on understanding and applying seven core principles derived from cognitive science, including prior knowledge, organization, motivation, mastery, practice, self-direction, and course climate, to foster meaningful and lasting learning.  
  
### **New or Surprising Perspective 🤔**  
This book moves beyond generic teaching advice by grounding instructional strategies in concrete cognitive science research. It emphasizes that learning is not a passive reception of information but an active, constructive process shaped by the learner's existing knowledge and cognitive processes. It also highlights the importance of fostering self-directed learning and creating a supportive learning environment, which are often overlooked in traditional teaching approaches. This might be surprising to educators who rely on traditional lecture methods or assume that students are solely responsible for their learning outcomes.
