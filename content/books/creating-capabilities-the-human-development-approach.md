🌍✨⚖️ Understand well-being and social justice by focusing on what individuals are able to do and be, rather than their resources or subjective satisfaction. It challenges traditional development metrics like GDP, advocating for policies that foster universal human dignity and enable a flourishing life for all.  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
### 💡 Core Philosophy  
* 🌱 **Capabilities Approach:** Normative framework focusing on real opportunities (capabilities) individuals possess to achieve lives they value.  
* ✨ **Functionings:** Actual beings and doings people achieve, which are outgrowths of capabilities (e.g., being well-nourished, having self-respect).  
* ➡️ **Shift in Focus:** Moves evaluation from means (resources, income) or subjective states (utility, happiness) to ends (what people can actually do and be).  
* 👑 **Human Dignity:** Central to Nussbaum's justification of fundamental capabilities.  
* 📉 **Critique of GDP:** Traditional economic indicators like GDP fail to capture quality of life, inequality, or access to basic needs.  
  
### 🔟 Nussbaum's Ten Central Capabilities  
* ❤️ **Life:** Live a normal length human life.  
* 🩺 **Bodily Health:** Good health, reproductive health, adequate nourishment, shelter.  
* 💪 **Bodily Integrity:** Move freely, secure against assault, sexual satisfaction, reproductive choice.  
* 🧠 **Senses, Imagination, and Thought:** Use senses, imagine, think, reason; education, cultural experiences, freedom of expression.  
* 😢 **Emotions:** Attachments, love, grieve; emotional development free from fear/anxiety.  
* 🤔 **Practical Reason:** Form conception of the good, critically reflect.  
* 🤝 **Affiliation:** Live with others, show concern, have self-respect, non-discrimination.  
* 🐾 **Other Species:** Live with concern for animals, plants, and nature.  
* 🥳 **Play:** Laugh, play, enjoy recreation.  
* 🌍 **Control Over One's Environment:**  
    * 🗳️ **Political:** Participate in political life, free speech, association.  
    * 🏠 **Material:** Hold property, seek employment on equal basis, freedom from unwarranted search.  
  
### 🛠️ Actionable Steps/Applications  
* 📝 **Policy Design:** Use capabilities as a framework for designing and evaluating public policies, especially in development and social welfare.  
* 😔 **Poverty Measurement:** Understand poverty as capability deprivation rather than merely income poverty.  
* 📊 **Human Development Index (HDI):** Influenced by the capabilities approach, focusing on health, education, and living standards, though recognized as a reductionist measure.  
* ⚖️ **Justice Framework:** Construct a theory of basic social justice by ensuring a threshold level of central capabilities for all citizens.  
  
## ⚖️ Evaluation  
  
* 💪 **Robust Framework:** The capabilities approach, particularly Nussbaum's articulation, offers a comprehensive, ethically grounded alternative to traditional welfare economics (e.g., utilitarianism) and resource-based theories (e.g., Rawlsian primary goods). It addresses the heterogeneity of individuals and their varying abilities to convert resources into valuable outcomes, a key critique of Rawls.  
* 🌐 **Universalism vs. Relativism:** Nussbaum's list of ten central capabilities is proposed as a universal set of entitlements, grounded in human dignity, which helps to bridge the gap between absolutism and relativism in human rights discourse. However, some scholars like Amartya Sen argue against a fixed list, preferring it to remain open to revision and local deliberation.  
* ↔️ **Distinction from Sen:** While building on Sen's pioneering work, Nussbaum distinguishes her approach by proposing a specific, normative list of capabilities and grounding it in a concept of human dignity. Sen, in contrast, emphasizes a more abstract evaluative space and prioritizes freedom and agency without prescribing a definitive list.  
* 📈 **Applications:** The approach has significant practical applications in development policy, health economics, education, and assessing social impact, influencing measures like the Human Development Index. Despite its influence, the HDI is recognized as a simplification of the full scope of the capabilities approach.  
* 🗽 **Freedom and Responsibility:** Nussbaum's work extends the capabilities approach by explicitly considering freedom in relation to responsibility, emphasizing the capacity of people to apply moral constraints to themselves, contrasting with Sen's view of freedom as purely functional rationality of choice.
