## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* 💧 Single handle faucets utilize a internal ball valve mechanism to regulate water flow and temperature from hot and cold supply lines.  
* 📉 Rubber seats and springs located beneath the ball valve wear down or corrode over time, which is the primary cause of faucet leaks.  
* 🛠️ Replacing these small components is a cost-effective alternative to replacing the entire faucet fixture.  
* 🔧 Gather replacement seats and springs, channel lock pliers, needle-nose pliers, an Allen wrench, and a cloth.  
* 🚱 Close the water shut off valve and open the faucet to drain lines and relieve pressure.  
* 🕳️ Plug the sink drain to ensure no small components are lost during the procedure.  
* 🔩 Pry off the screw cover and use an Allen wrench or Phillips screwdriver to remove the handle set screw.  
* 🖐️ Pull the handle off and use needle-nose pliers to unscrew the internal adjusting ring.  
* 🧢 Protect the finish with a cloth and use channel lock pliers to unscrew the decorative cap.  
* 🧩 Lift out the cam, packing, and the ball valve from the faucet body.  
* 🧼 Use a cloth to soak up remaining water in the faucet shank to see the seats clearly.  
* 📐 Hook the old rubber seats with an Allen wrench, tilt to catch the spring, and lift both out.  
* 🔼 Place new wedge-shaped springs into the holes with the wider base at the bottom.  
* 🔘 Fit the new rubber seats over the springs as a cap and press into place.  
* 📍 Reinstall the ball valve by aligning the metal pin on the faucet body to the slot on the ball.  
* 📁 Place the cam and packing over the ball, aligning the plastic tab to the corresponding slot.  
* ✋ Hold the cam in place with thumb pressure while hand-tightening the cap to prevent rotation.  
* 🔄 Tighten the adjusting ring with needle-nose pliers, reattach the handle, and restore water supply.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* ⚖️ This tutorial demonstrates repairs for Delta style ball faucets, but The Spruce Guide to Faucet Types notes that Moen or cartridge-style faucets utilize a single removable cylinder rather than separate seats and springs.  
* 🛠️ For a more durable repair, DIY Plumbing Advice from This Old House suggests inspecting the ball valve for scratches or mineral buildup, as a damaged ball will quickly ruin new rubber seats.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 🛠️ Q: What happens if the pin is not aligned when putting a ball valve back into a single handle faucet?  
  
🔀 A: The faucet handle will not move correctly or the water will fail to shut off because the ball cannot seat properly against the hot and cold inlets without correct pin alignment.  
  
### 💧 Q: How tight should the decorative cap be screwed back onto a ball-style kitchen faucet?  
  
✋ A: The decorative cap should be hand-tightened while holding the internal cam steady; using pliers can over-tighten the assembly, potentially cracking plastic parts or making the handle difficult to operate.  
  
### 🧩 Q: Which way do the springs face when replacing seats and springs in a leaky faucet?  
  
🔼 A: The metal springs are wedge-shaped and must be inserted into the faucet body with the wider base at the bottom and the narrower end facing up to support the rubber seat.
