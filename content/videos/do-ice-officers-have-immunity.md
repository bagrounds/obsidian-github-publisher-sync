## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
- ⚖️ While the video discusses the potential for state prosecution, the Congressional Research Service report titled Qualified Immunity: An Overview by the Library of Congress notes that the legal bar for overcoming immunity is exceptionally high, requiring a violation of clearly established law.  
- 🔍 This suggests that while states have the power to try, winning is statistically rare.  
- 📚 Further exploration of the Supremacy Clause and the 1890 Neagle decision would provide a better understanding of why federal courts often block state charges against agents.
