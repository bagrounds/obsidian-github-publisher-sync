    * 📊 Different types of networks (e.g., 🎲 random, 🌍 small-world, ⚖️ scale-free).  
    * 📏 Measures of network properties (e.g., 🔢 degree distribution, 🏘️ clustering coefficient, 🛣️ path lengths).  
    * 🧬 Models of network formation (e.g., ➕ preferential attachment).  
* 🌊 **Cascades and Diffusion:**  
    * 📢 How information, ✨ innovations, and 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ behaviors spread through networks.  
    * 🚦 Threshold models and their implications for the reach of cascades.  
    * 📢 Influence maximization in networks.  
* 🛒 **Market Dynamics:**  
    * ♟️ Game theory and strategic interactions in networked markets.  
    * 💰 Auctions and mechanism design in online environments.  
    * ⭐ Reputation systems and trust in decentralized markets.  
* 🗺️ **Search and Navigation:**  
    * 🔍 Algorithms for finding information in large networks.  
    * 🧭 Decentralized search and the small-world phenomenon.  
    * 🥇 Ranking algorithms (e.g., 📄 PageRank).
