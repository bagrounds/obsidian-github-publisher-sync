# [❓📈🤦 Failing to Understand the Exponential, Again](https://www.julian.ac/blog/2025/09/27/failing-to-understand-the-exponential-again)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
- 📈 **AI discourse** regarding a "bubble" parallels the failure to grasp **Covid-19's** exponential spread.  
- 🦠 **Commentators** missed the pandemic's scale, treating it as **remote** after exponential trends became obvious.  
- 🚫 Model mistakes prompt conclusions that AI will never reach **human-level performance** or will have only **minor impact**.  
- 📉 Lack of conversational change across model releases suggests AI is **plateauing** and **scaling is over**.  
- 💻 The **METR study** documents a clear **exponential trend** in autonomous **software engineering task length**.  
- 🚀 **Sonnet 3.7** achieved 50% success on one-hour tasks; **recent models** exceed this, completing tasks over **2 hours**.  
- 💼 **OpenAI's GDPval study** measures performance across **44 occupations** in 9 industries.  
- 📊 Evaluation shows a similar trend, with **GPT-5** nearing human performance.  
- 🥇 **Claude Opus 4.1** significantly outperforms GPT-5, almost matching **industry expert** performance.  
- ⏳ Models will autonomously work **8-hour days** by **mid-2026**.  
- 🧑‍🔬 At least one model will **match human experts** across many industries before **late 2026**.  
- 🧠 By **late 2027**, models will frequently **outperform experts** on many tasks.  
- ⚠️ **Grok 4** and **Gemini 2.5 Pro** underperformance is notable given previous **state-of-the-art claims**.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
* ⚖️ The **analogy** to the Covid-19 pandemic is **contrasted** with the mechanism of AI progress by commentators.  
* 🦠 For **COVID-19**, the spread of infection is an understood, deductive exponential process, unlike the **fuzzier process** underlying the AI boom.  
* ⚙️ AI improvement is considered closer to **Moore's law**, which depends on the whole industry focusing on new innovations, suggesting improvements are **not inevitable**.  
* 📋 The **METR** and **GDPval** tasks are **contrasted** with real-world work by being characterized as not "messy."  
* 📝 METR's benchmark tasks have a mean messiness score of **~3/16**, while a regular software engineering task is **7-8**, suggesting current evaluations do not capture the large variety of real-world work.  
* 🔮 A **legitimate perspective** posits that AI may be able to perform non-messy tasks for eight hours at a 50% success rate and outperform experts, yet somehow **fail to replace anyone**, similar to the introduction of technology to **radiologists**.  
* 🤝 The **topic to explore** for better understanding is the creation of evaluations that include both **messier** and **longer horizon** tasks.  
* 🛠️ Another **topic to explore** is how to best structure the **human-AI collaboration** necessary for ultra-high productivity, where AI functions as a very smart tool rather than a replacement.

This book explores the **risks and implications** of an intelligence explosion, directly addressing the possibility of a rapid, exponential AGI takeoff often missed by linear thinking.  
- ⏳ **The Singularity Is Near** by Ray Kurzweil. The seminal text arguing that technological change is accelerating exponentially, leading to a "singularity" where AI surpasses human intelligence, reinforcing the article's core theme.  
- [🤖📈 The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies](../books/the-second-machine-age-work-progress-and-prosperity-in-a-time-of-brilliant-technologies.md) by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. It explores how digital technologies, particularly AI, are transforming labor and society, supporting the argument for **rapid, exponential change**.  
  
### ⚖️ **Contrasting**  
- **[🧠🧠🧠🧠 A Thousand Brains: A New Theory of Intelligence](../books/a-thousand-brains.md)** by Jeff Hawkins. This work offers a biologically-grounded **theory of intelligence** suggesting current AI architectures may be fundamentally flawed or missing key elements, offering a potential **plateauing mechanism** that contrasts the article's optimism.  
- 🌍 **Poverty, by America** by Matthew Desmond. A deeply contrasting societal analysis that focuses on the **distributional failures** of a wealthy society, forcing a necessary consideration of where exponential technological gains might fail to solve fundamental human problems.  
- 🐌 The Myth of the AI Revolution by Kate Crawford. This work offers a critical, structuralist perspective, arguing that AI is not a disembodied intelligence but a system built on **vast resources and political choices**, suggesting a slower, more complex path to 'revolution' that contrasts the article's simple extrapolation.  
  
### 💡 **Creatively Related**  
- **[⚫🦢🎲 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable](../books/the-black-swan-the-impact-of-the-highly-improbable.md)** by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. This book discusses the impact of **highly improbable, high-impact events**—like a sudden AGI breakthrough—that are inherently unpredictable but reshape history, illustrating why the future is not merely an extrapolation of the past.  
- 💥 **The Shock of the New** by Robert Hughes. A history of modern art that deals with how society adapts—or **fails to adapt**—to relentless, high-velocity change in culture and technology, linking the emotional and cultural impact of **exponential progress**.  
- [📉📈🌪️💪 Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder](../books/antifragile-things-that-gain-from-disorder.md) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. This book discusses systems that not only withstand shocks but _benefit_ from them, providing a framework for how individuals and institutions can prepare for a future shaped by **unpredictable, exponentially growing technologies**.
