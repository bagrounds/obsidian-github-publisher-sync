### [141.¬†Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle)  
> Given¬†`head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.  
> There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the¬†`next`¬†pointer. Internally,¬†`pos`¬†is used to denote the index of the node that¬†tail's¬†`next`¬†pointer is connected to.¬†**Note that¬†`pos`¬†is not passed as a parameter**.  
> Return¬†`true`¬†_if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return¬†`false`.  
  
#### ü™û Reflections  
1. This was a good warm up for my upcoming interview, later today  
2. No bugs, optimal solution, correct submission on first attempt in under 14 minutes is pretty good!  
  
#### ‚å®Ô∏è My Solution  
```ts  
/* Deterimine if there is a cycle in a linked list  
- Easy: collect nodes in a set and check if each new node exists in the set  
  - Note: O(N) extra memory usage  
- Old PhD Thesis method, turned ubiquitous interview question: send out multiple cursors at different paces and return if they're ever at the same node  
  - O(1) extra memory usage  
Both methods have O(N) run-time complexity  
[2:24] Done planning  
[6:34] Done with initial implementation  
[9:18] Done with test  
[13:25] Successful submission
