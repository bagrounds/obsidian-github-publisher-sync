* 🍫 **Combating Instant Gratification:** Addresses why humans often prioritize immediate rewards over larger future ones and provides strategies to counter this tendency.  
* 💪 **Practical Habits & Techniques:** Offers actionable strategies such as using commitment devices, 🧘 mindfulness techniques grounded in neuroscience, and methods to improve focus and overcome distractions.  
* 🏆 **Goal Achievement Framework:** Implicitly links strengthened self-discipline to the ability to resist distractions and stay focused on achieving difficult, long-term objectives. 👨‍⚕️ Psychologist Roy Baumeister's three components for goal achievement (motivation/clear goal, behavior monitoring, willpower) are noted as foundational.
