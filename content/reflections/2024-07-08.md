## 🏋 Coding Practice  
Today I'll implement the more direct recursive solution discussed [yesterday](./2024-07-07.md).  
  
### [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree)  
> Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).  
  
#### 🪞 Reflections  
1. This is a shorter and more direct solution that what I came up with on my own.  
2. While I didn't time it, this only took a few minutes to implement.  
3. It may be another nice exercise to mechanically translate this unusual recursive function into an iterative function.  
  
#### ⌨️ The Solution  
```ts  
function areMirrors(t1: TreeNode | null, t2: TreeNode | null): boolean {  
  if (!t1 && !t2) return true  
  if (!t1 || !t2) return false  
  if (t1.val !== t2.val) return false  
  return areMirrors(t1.left, t2.right) && areMirrors(t1.right, t2.left)  
}  
  
function isSymmetric(root: TreeNode | null): boolean {  
  return areMirrors(root, root)  
}  
```
