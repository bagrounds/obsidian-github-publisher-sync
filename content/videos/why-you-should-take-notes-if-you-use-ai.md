# 💡🧠🤖📝 Why you should take notes if you use AI

## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* 🧠 Shift from prompt engineering to context engineering by using note-taking systems to provide LLMs with high-quality background data. \[[00:08](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=8)]  
* 📤 Externalize tacit knowledge from your brain into explicit notes to enable effective collaboration with AI and other people. \[[01:04](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=64)]  
* 🛠️ Employ six categories for context: role, goal, audience, constraints, inputs, and the source of truth. \[[03:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=194)]  
* ⚖️ Define judgment criteria and frameworks within your notes so the AI understands your specific standards for quality. \[[05:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=310)]  
* 🧪 Reverse-engineer your own frameworks by feeding the AI examples of what you consider good and bad work. \[[07:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=432)]  
* 🕵️ Use AI as a synthesis tool to spot deep patterns across thousands of personal notes that are difficult for humans to digest manually. \[[16:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=994)]  
* 📈 Combat the risk of becoming less intelligent by deeply engaging with the AI through your own processed context rather than just consuming its generic outputs. \[[08:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=502)]  
* 🏗️ Build compounding intellectual property by documenting ideas, ensuring your thinking builds over time instead of starting from scratch. \[[25:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=1525)]  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* ⚖️ The speaker emphasizes personal note-taking as a primary context source, which aligns with the Second Brain methodology popularized by Tiago Forte in his book Building a Second Brain.  
* 🌐 While the video focuses on manual note-taking, current industry trends in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) explore automating this context injection for enterprise-scale data, a topic explored by IBM Technology in various AI architectural overviews.  
* 🔎 Future areas of exploration include the privacy implications of feeding personal vaults into LLMs and the technical hurdles of maintaining large-scale local context for individual users.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 📂 Q: How does context engineering differ from standard prompt engineering?  
  
📂 A: Prompt engineering focuses on the phrasing of the instruction, while context engineering provides the deep background data, specific frameworks, and personal knowledge necessary for the AI to produce specialized rather than generic results. \[[04:05](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=245)]  
  
### 📝 Q: What is the most effective way to teach an AI my personal style?  
  
📝 A: Provide the AI with clear examples of both good and bad work from your past, then ask the model to distill the underlying framework or patterns that distinguish the two. \[[07:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=432)]  
  
### 🧠 Q: Can using AI actually make a person less capable of thinking?  
  
🧠 A: Yes, if the user simply outsources the thinking process; however, by using personal notes to drive the conversation, the user can engage more deeply and access insights beyond their normal mental capacity. \[[08:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=502)]  
  
### 🏗️ Q: What specific categories should be included in a context-rich note?  
  
🏗️ A: Effective context includes the role the AI should play, the ultimate goal, the target audience, format constraints, the data inputs, and the source of truth that outranks generic information. \[[03:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtJYJF8QodM&t=194)]
