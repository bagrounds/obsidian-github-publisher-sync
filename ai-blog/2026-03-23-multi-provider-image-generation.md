# 2026-03-23 | 🔗 Multi-Provider Image Generation — Fallback Chains for Resilient AI Art

## 🎯 The Problem

🚫 When our Cloudflare Workers AI image generation hit its daily rate limit, the entire backfill job stopped dead. 📉 Posts that could have received images sat waiting until tomorrow's run, even though other free-tier services had unused capacity.

💡 We needed a way to automatically switch to an alternative image generation service when the primary one ran out of quota — without stopping the job.

## 🔬 The Research

🌐 We evaluated several free-tier AI image generation APIs as potential fallback providers:

| 🏢 Service | 🆓 Free Tier | ⚡ Speed | 🎨 Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🤗 Hugging Face Inference API | ✅ No credit card needed, ~300 req/hour | 🐢 Variable (cold starts) | ⭐ Excellent (FLUX.1, Stable Diffusion) |
| 🤝 Together AI | 💳 $25 credits (then pay-as-you-go) | ⚡ Fast | ⭐ Excellent |
| 🔄 Replicate | 💳 $5 credits (then pay-as-you-go) | ⚡ Fast | ⭐ Excellent |
| 🏎️ fal.ai | 💳 Free credits (limited) | ⚡ Sub-3s rendering | ⭐ Excellent |

🏆 **Hugging Face** won because it offers truly free access with no credit card required, a simple REST API, and access to the same FLUX.1-schnell model family already used by Cloudflare.

## 🔧 What Changed

### 🔗 Provider Chain Architecture

🏗️ Instead of a single image provider, the system now maintains an ordered chain of providers:

```
☁️ Cloudflare → 🤗 Hugging Face → 🤖 Gemini
```

🔄 When a provider exhausts its quota (HTTP 429 or daily limit) or becomes unavailable (HTTP 410, 401, 403), the system automatically switches to the next provider and retries the same image. ➡️ Once switched, all remaining candidates use the new provider.

### 📊 New Types and Functions

🆕 The `ImageProviderConfig` interface gained a `name` field for observability:

```typescript
interface ImageProviderConfig {
  readonly name: string;        // "cloudflare" | "huggingface" | "gemini"
  readonly apiKey: string;
  readonly model: string;
  readonly generator: ImageGenerator;
  readonly describePrompt?: PromptDescriber;
}
```

🔧 A new `resolveImageProviders(env)` function returns all configured providers as an ordered array, while the original `resolveImageProvider(env)` returns just the first one (backward compatible).

🤗 A new `generateWithHuggingFace` function handles the Hugging Face Inference API via `https://router.huggingface.co/hf-inference/models/` — returning binary image data instead of base64 JSON.

### 🔄 Backfill Fallback Logic

📦 The `backfillImages` function now accepts `fallbackProviders`:

```typescript
interface BackfillConfig {
  // ...existing fields...
  readonly fallbackProviders?: readonly ImageProviderConfig[];
}
```

🎯 The fallback behavior during batch backfill:

1. 🔄 Try the primary provider
2. 🛑 On quota exhaustion OR provider unavailable → emit `provider_switch` event → try next provider
3. 🔁 Retry the same candidate with the new provider
4. ❌ Only stop when ALL providers are exhausted

### 🛡️ Provider Unavailable Detection

🆕 A new `isProviderUnavailableError` classifier detects permanent provider failures:

- 🚫 HTTP 410 (Gone) — API endpoint deprecated or moved
- 🔒 HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) — invalid or expired credentials
- ⛔ HTTP 403 (Forbidden) — access denied
- 📝 Messages containing "no longer supported" or "deprecated"

🎯 Unlike quota errors (which trigger retries first), unavailable errors immediately switch to the next provider — no wasted retries against a permanently broken endpoint.

### 🔬 5 Whys: The HuggingFace 410 Bug

1. ❓ **Why 410 errors?** — HuggingFace deprecated `api-inference.huggingface.co` in favor of `router.huggingface.co`
2. ❓ **Why wrong URL?** — `generateWithHuggingFace` hardcoded the old URL
3. ❓ **Why did the system keep trying?** — 410 errors fell through to the generic error handler, which logged them but continued to the next candidate with the same broken provider
4. ❓ **Why no provider switch?** — Only quota errors triggered provider switching
5. ❓ **Why no "provider broken" category?** — The original design only anticipated transient rate limits, not permanent provider failures

✅ **Fix**: Updated URL + added `isProviderUnavailableError` to immediately switch providers on permanent failures.

## 🤗 Setting Up Hugging Face

📋 Getting your Hugging Face token:

1. 🌐 Create a free account at huggingface.co
2. ⚙️ Go to Settings → Access Tokens
3. 🔑 Create a fine-grained token with Inference API permissions
4. 📋 Copy the token (starts with `hf_`)
5. 🔐 Add it as a GitHub secret named `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN`

🆓 No credit card needed. 🎨 Uses the same FLUX.1-schnell model family as Cloudflare.

## 🧪 Testing

✅ 31 new tests cover the provider chain and unavailable handling:

| 📋 Test | 🎯 What It Verifies |
|---|---|
| 🔄 Switch on quota exhaustion | ✅ Primary → fallback transition works |
| 🛑 Stop when all exhausted | ✅ Returns stoppedByQuota only after all providers fail |
| ➡️ Continue with fallback | ✅ Remaining candidates processed by new provider |
| 📅 Daily quota switch | ✅ Daily quota errors trigger provider switch too |
| 🔙 Backward compatible | ✅ Works identically without fallbackProviders |
| 🔗 Multi-provider chain | ✅ Chains through 3+ providers correctly |
| 📊 Progress events | ✅ Provider name included in all events |
| 🚫 410 Gone switch | ✅ Immediately switches provider, no retries |
| 🔒 401 Unauthorized switch | ✅ Bad credentials trigger provider switch |
| 🔁 No retry on unavailable | ✅ Broken provider called exactly once |
| 💀 All providers unavailable | ✅ Stops gracefully when none work |

📈 Total: 211 tests across 42 suites, all passing. 958 total across all suites.

## 🎯 The Result

🔋 Before: Cloudflare quota exhaustion = job stops. Provider API deprecation = infinite loop of identical errors.

🚀 After: Quota exhaustion = seamless switch to next provider. Provider deprecation = immediate switch, no wasted retries.

🏗️ The provider chain architecture is designed for easy extension — adding a new provider requires only implementing a generator function and adding a block to `resolveImageProviders`.
