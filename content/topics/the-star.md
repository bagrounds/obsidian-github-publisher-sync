## 🎶 Lyrics  
✨ Twinkle, twinkle, little star,  
🤔 How I wonder what you are!  
⬆️ Up above the world so high,  
💎 Like a diamond in the sky.  
  
🔥 When the blazing sun is gone,  
🌑 When he nothing shines upon,  
💡 Then you show your little light,  
✨ Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.  
  
🚶 Then the trav'ller in the dark,  
🙏 Thanks you for your tiny spark,  
🧭 He could not see which way to go,  
✨ If you did not twinkle so.  
  
🌌 In the dark blue sky you keep,  
👀 And often thro' my curtains peep,  
👁️ For you never shut your eye,  
☀️ Till the sun is in the sky.  
  
✨ 'Tis your bright and tiny spark,  
🔦 Lights the trav'ller in the dark:  
🤔 Tho' I know not what you are,  
⭐ Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
