# [🤖👨‍💻📈⏳ Learnings from two years of using AI tools for software engineering](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/two-years-of-using-ai)  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* AI coding assistants like [🤖💻🪄 GitHub Copilot for VS Code](../software/github-copilot-for-vs-code.md) are used to scaffold entire classes 📚 and auto-complete logical structures.  
* ChatGPT has evolved 📈 from a coding assistant to a sounding board for architectural discussions 🤔, ideation, and problem-solving.  
* The mental shift from viewing AI as a tool to a collaborator 🤝 is critical for exponential gains 🚀.  
* Productivity gains come from thinking in parallel 👯‍♀️ and delegating ✍️ subtasks to AI.  
* Engineers must act as managers 🧑‍💼, providing precise context and detailed feedback 📝 to the AI.  
* A key to quality is restraint 🛑 and continuous refactoring, as AI may produce over-engineered 🛠️ or complex solutions.  
* The entire work experience for engineers is evolving 🔄 weekly.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
The provided content offers a perspective 🧐 from a company that has successfully adopted AI 🤖 tools in its workflow. It provides a practical, real-world account of AI integration, contrasting with more theoretical discussions about AI's impact on software engineering. The piece focuses on the practical application and the cultural shift required for success, moving beyond the simple "productivity boost" narrative. For a better understanding, it would be beneficial to explore perspectives 🗣️ from individuals or teams that have had negative experiences with AI integration, perhaps due to challenges with code quality, security vulnerabilities, or the 'black box' nature of AI outputs. It would also be valuable to explore how AI affects junior versus senior developers 🧑‍💻.
