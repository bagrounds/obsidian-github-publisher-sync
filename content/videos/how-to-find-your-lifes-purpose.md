## 🤖 AI Summary  
This 🎬 video 🎯 challenges the common 💡 advice of asking "What's my 💖 passion?" to find your 🗺️ purpose, suggesting it's an 🚫 ineffective question \[[00:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=6)\]. Instead, it offers 7️⃣ alternative, "brutally honest" ❓ questions designed to help individuals 🔍 discover what truly drives them \[[00:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=12)\].  
  
Here are the 7️⃣ questions discussed:  
  
* **🤔 What made me 🤪 weird as a 🧒 kid?** This ❓ question encourages revisiting 👧 childhood interests and 🤪 quirks that set you ↔️ apart, as these ⏳ early fascinations can be 💪 strong indicators of what drives you \[[00:19](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=19)\]. 📚 Research suggests that 🤸 childhood play can even 📈 influence adult 💼 career choices \[[01:11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=71)\].  
* **⏰ When do I ↔️ lose track of ⌚ time?** This 📍 points to the concept of "🌊 flow," a state of complete 🧘 absorption where ⏳ hours pass like ⏱️ minutes \[[01:41](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=101)\]. 🏃 Activities that lead to this 🧘 state are intrinsically 🎁 rewarding and are 🔑 key components of 🗺️ purpose \[[02:27](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=147)\].  
* **🙏 What do 👥 people 💖 thank me for?** The 🙏 gratitude of 🤝 others can 💡 reveal how you 🤝 make a difference and where your 🤝 contributions intersect with what you ❤️ love \[[02:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=162)\]. The 🎬 video suggests 🗣️ asking others directly if you're ❓ unsure of your "💪 superpowers" \[[03:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=203)\].  
* **📝 What's my ✍️ sentence?** 💡 Inspired by 🏛️ political advice, this ❓ question asks you to 📝 summarize your life's 🗺️ purpose in a ☝️ single ✍️ sentence, focusing on ☝️ one or ✌️ two truly 🎯 important things you want to be 💭 remembered for \[[03:50](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=230)\].  
* **🌍 Where can I make my 📈 biggest 🤝 contribution?** This ↔️ shifts the 🎯 focus from 👤 self to 🤝 others, asking what 🤝 needs exist in your 🏘️ community, 🤝 team, or among 👥 people around you \[[05:23](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=323)\]. 🗺️ Purpose is often 🔍 found by 🤝 serving others and 🤝 contributing beyond 👤 oneself \[[06:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=366)\].  
* **💰 What would I do if I didn't have to make 💵 money?** This 💭 hypothetical ❓ question encourages 🧹 stripping away practical 😟 worries to 💡 uncover intrinsic 💡 motivations \[[06:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=382)\]. 💡 Understanding what you'd do for 🆓 free can help 🔄 reorient your 🧬 life, even if 📉 progress is 🐌 gradual \[[07:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=442)\].  
* **👴 What will I 😔 regret when I'm 9️⃣0️⃣?** By 🖼️ picturing yourself at 9️⃣0️⃣ years 👴 old, you can 🎯 identify potential 😔 regrets, particularly those of 🚫 inaction \[[07:37](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=457)\]. The 🎬 video emphasizes that most 👥 people 😔 regret what they 🚫 didn't do more than what they did, especially 🚫 not being 💥 bolder \[[07:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=476)\]. ↔️ Conversely, 💭 thinking about what you'd be 🏆 proud of at 9️⃣0️⃣ can also 💡 offer 🔑 clues to your 🗺️ purpose \[[08:38](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEQL2ZRDRVM&t=518)\].

## 🤔 Evaluation  
This 🎬 video offers a 🔄 refreshing perspective on 🔍 finding one's 🗺️ purpose by moving ↔️ beyond the often-vague concept of "💖 passion." It provides 💡 actionable questions that encourage  introspective 💭 thought and a 💡 shift from self-focus to 🤝 contribution.
