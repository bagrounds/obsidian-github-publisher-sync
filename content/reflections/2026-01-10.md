## ☕🥦🥩🍚🍔🍦 When should I eat what?  
- ⚡ For abundant energy  
    - ⏳ Intermittent fasting  
        - 🍱 In order to keep my eating window small, I've been delaying my first meal until noon for months.  
        - 🥗 But eating triggers cortisol, which we want plenty of in the morning.  
        - 🤔 So should I eat first thing, in order to boost my morning cortisol or wait until noon to give my organs a break?  
        - 💡 Maybe I should eat first thing in the morning and stop eating earlier in the evening.

## 🤖🐲 AI Fiction  
  
🔊 The vacuum hummed, rattling Caleb’s teeth. 🚿 He watched the nozzle as crimson slush vanished.  
  
⏱️ "Six minutes until the salt trucks," a voice crackled. 🧼 "You know the drill. Spotless by sunrise."  
  
🧊 Caleb didn't look up. 🚐 He dragged a blue parka toward the unmarked van and heaved the body over the floorboards.  
  
🛰️ "Drone footage is looped," the voice said. 🔫 "Get the bodies inside and clear the brass."  
  
🧤 Caleb knelt, plucking casings from the ice with practiced efficiency.  
  
🛑 The last body lay near the hydrant. 👮🏽‍♂️ Caleb paused, his fingers brushing a badge pinned to navy wool: Jace Miller. 🏘️ He glanced at the quiet porches, then back at the name.  
  
☀️ "Caleb. Move it. The sun’s coming up."  
  
🕳️ Caleb unclipped the badge and shoved it into the gutter. 🌊 He turned the high-pressure hose on the remaining stains, watching the red melt into the sewer until the concrete was bone-white.
