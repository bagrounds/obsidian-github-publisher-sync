## 🤖 AI Summary  
### 🤔 TL;DR: How Democracies Die  
  
⚠️ Democracies erode not through 💥 violent overthrow, but through the 🐌 gradual weakening of 🏛️ democratic norms and 🏢 institutions by 🗳️ elected leaders who, while maintaining a 🎭 veneer of legality, undermine the 🧱 very foundations of 🤝 democratic governance.  
  
### 😮 A New Perspective  
  
📖 This book shifts the focus from dramatic 💥 coups to the subtle, 🐌 incremental erosion of democratic norms. 🏛️ Instead of focusing on external 🌍 threats, it highlights how democracies can be dismantled 🧱 from within 🏠 by leaders 👨‍💼 who exploit 😈 existing political 🏛️ divisions ⚔️ and weaken 📉 the checks and balances ⚖️ designed to restrain 💪 power. ⚠️ This is a warning 🚨 for complacent 😴 democracies.
