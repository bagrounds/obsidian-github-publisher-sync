Murphy, and Brian G. Murray. 🗓️ A second edition, reflecting significant advances, particularly in genomics and biotechnology, was published in 2016/2017.  
* 🌱 It aims to bridge foundational plant science knowledge with its practical applications in areas like agriculture, food production, and industry.  
* 🔬 The encyclopedia covers the core theories, knowledge, and techniques used by plant scientists. 🌾 It emphasizes the application of biological science advancements to produce sustainable food, feed, ingredients, and renewable raw materials.  
* 🌍 It also addresses ecological concerns, 🦠 plant pathology, 🧬 genetics, 🍃 physiology, 🧪 biochemistry, 🧬 biotechnology, and the ethical considerations surrounding modern plant science techniques.  
  
### ✨ Key Features  
* ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage:** 🌳 Addresses over 25 distinct areas of plant science, including abiotic stresses, crop improvement, biotechnology, photosynthesis, plant nutrition, pests and diseases, ecology, genetics, physiology, and ethics. 🌾 The second edition adds specific chapters on major crops and crop types.  
* 👨‍🔬 **Expert Contributions:** ✍️ Edited and written by a distinguished international group of experts.  
* 🗂️ **Organization:** 📝 Entries are designed to be concise and readable, with a well-organized format, thorough cross-referencing, and glossary sections for clear definitions of terms.  
* 🖼️ **Illustrations:** 📊 Features numerous tables, figures, and color plates in each volume.  
* 💻 **Accessibility:** 🖨️ Available in print (typically as a 3-volume set) and online via ScienceDirect, offering enhanced searchability and linking features.  
  
### 🎯 Target Audience  
* 👩‍🔬 Researchers, scientists, and academics in plant science, agriculture, biotechnology, and related fields.
