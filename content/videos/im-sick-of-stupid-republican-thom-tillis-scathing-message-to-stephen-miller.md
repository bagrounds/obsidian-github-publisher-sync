## 🤖 AI Summary

* 🛡️ Article 5 has been exercised only once in NATO history to defend the United States after September 11.  
* 🕯️ Over 18,000 Danish soldiers deployed and 43 lost their lives fighting alongside American forces.  
* 📉 Denmark suffered over six times the fatality rate of Germany per capita during these missions.  
* ❄️ The U.S. can project power into the Arctic using existing Greenland installations without taking over the territory.  
* 🤝 Amateurish comments about seizing territory destabilize the most important alliance in U.S. history.
