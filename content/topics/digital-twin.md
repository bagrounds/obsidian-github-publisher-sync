image_prompt: A split-composition illustration featuring a sleek, physical object—such as a modern industrial turbine or a human silhouette—on the left side, rendered in warm, natural lighting. A glowing, translucent geometric mesh or wireframe version of the same object occupies the right side, rendered in cool, electric blues and cyans. Thin, luminous data-stream lines connect the two, symbolizing the flow of sensor data. The background is a deep, minimalist slate gray, emphasizing the contrast between the organic, solid form and the synthetic, digital reflection. Small, floating nodes of light hover around the digital side to represent real-time data points, creating a clean, high-tech aesthetic that conveys precision, observation, and technological synchronization.

## An Operational Definition  
Digital twin - a digital representation of the recent state of a subject; a means of observation  
  
```mermaid  
graph LR  
R[🕑 Subject] -->|🌐| D[2️⃣ Digital Twin]  
```  
  
## Essentials  
1. A subject to observe  
2. A sensor to measure the subject  
3. A means of capturing sensor measurements in a digital form  
4. A data schema to represent the measured state  
5. Transmission of measurements to storage  
6. Digital storage for the state of the subject  
  
```mermaid  
graph  
S[🌡️ Subject]  
M[👁️ Sensor]  
X[💾 Storage]  
M -->|📏 Measure| S  
M -->|📷 Capture\n➡️ Convert\n📡 Transmit| X  
```  
  
## Why?  
👁️ Observe -> 🧑‍🔬 Experiment -> 🧠 Understand -> 🔮 Predict -> 💭 Simulate -> 🗺️ Plan -> 🎮 Control  
  
## Extensions  
- saving multiple states with timestamps yields a historical record for study  
- synthesizing and filtering multiple measurements allows for error correction and improved accuracy  
- mathematical models allow simulation and prediction  
- frequent updates allow for rapid response to real-time events and high fidelity historical records  
- digital twins with networked effector interfaces allow closed loop control systems to be built  
  
## Examples  
- ⌚ Smartwatches  
  - measure physiology, movement, and position  
  - to understand and improve behavior and health  
- 📦 shipment tracking  
  - measures the position of packages  
  - to understand and improve delivery performance  
- ✈️ instrumented machines  
  - measure operating parameters  
  - to understand and improve performance and maintenance  
- 🌐 instrumented software systems  
  - measure resources, performance, and usage metrics  
  - to understand and improve product performance, operations, and maintenance
