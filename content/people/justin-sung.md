**📚 Core Books on Learning Science & Effective Strategies:**  
1. **[🧠🔒 Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning](../books/make-it-stick.md) by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, and Mark A. McDaniel:** 💡 This is often considered a foundational text in effective learning. 🚫 It explains why many common study methods are inefficient and offers concrete, research-backed strategies like retrieval practice, spaced repetition, and elaboration. 💡 Justin Sung's focus on "encoding" and deep understanding aligns well with the principles in this book.  
2. 📈 "A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science (Even If You Flunked Algebra)" by Barbara Oakley: ➕➖➗ While aimed at math and science, the principles are broadly applicable. 🧠 Oakley, a former "language person" who became an engineering professor, shares practical insights into overcoming learning challenges, dealing with procrastination, and leveraging different modes of thinking.  
3. [🚀🧠🏆 Ultralearning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career](../books/ultralearning-master-hard-skills-outsmart-the-competition-and-accelerate-your-career.md) by Scott H. Young: 🏆 Scott H. Young is another prominent figure in the "learning to learn" space. 🗺️ This book provides a framework for rapidly acquiring challenging skills, emphasizing intense, self-directed learning projects. 💪 His ideas on "directness" and "drilling" could complement Sung's focus on efficient practice.  
4. 🏫 "Why Don't Students Like School?: A Cognitive Scientist Answers Questions About How the Mind Works and What It Means for the Classroom" by Daniel T. Willingham: 🧑‍🏫 Willingham explains core principles of cognitive psychology that are directly relevant to learning and memory in an accessible way. 🤔 Understanding how the mind works is key to designing effective learning strategies.  
5. **[⛰️📈🥇 Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise](../books/peak.md) by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool:** 🎯 This book delves into the concept of "deliberate practice" and explains what it truly takes to achieve expertise in any field. 🎯 This aligns with Justin Sung's emphasis on targeted, effective practice.  
  
**📚 Books that touch on related concepts:**  
6. **[⚛️🔄 Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones](../books/atomic-habits.md) by James Clear:** 🗓️ While not solely about learning, this book on habit formation is highly relevant to building effective study routines and self-management, which Justin Sung also emphasizes. 🗣️ He has also mentioned this book as an influence in an interview, noting how Clear distills complex research into an accessible format.  
7. **[🤔🐇🐢 Thinking, Fast and Slow](../books/thinking-fast-and-slow.md) by Daniel Kahneman:** 🧠 A Nobel laureate's deep dive into the two systems of thinking that govern our minds. 🤯 While complex, understanding these cognitive processes can provide a valuable foundation for improving how you approach learning and decision-making.  
8. 📖 "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer J. Adler & Charles Van Doren: 👓 A classic guide to active and intelligent reading. 🧐 Given Sung's emphasis on deep understanding and inquiry-based learning, this book's approach to critical reading would be very relevant.
