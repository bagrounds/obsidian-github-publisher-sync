## 🤖 AI Summary  
- 💤 The Nap Wheel shows the proportionate relationship between sleep stages.  
- ⏰ It is based on normal sleep/wake schedules and is accurate for people who aren’t excessively sleep-deprived.  
- 🧠 The tool helps you design and refine a nap to get the benefits you want.  
- ⚙️ The outer edge of the wheel represents the 24 hours of the day.  
- 🔵 The bright blue circle represents the amount of REM sleep, which is highest before 1 P.M.  
- 🟡 The yellow circle represents the amount of Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS), which increases the longer you've been awake.  
- 😴 The first 20 minutes of any nap are almost exclusively devoted to Stage 2 sleep.  
- 🕒 To use the wheel, you set the “wake-up time” dial to the hour you woke up.  
- 👍 A 90-minute nap at 1:30 P.M. is what is called the “perfect nap.”  
- 🎯 The wheel allows you to dial up the nap that's right for you, whether you want alertness (Stage 2), body repair (SWS), or creativity and memory consolidation (REM).  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
📖 The text provides a specific methodology, but it would be beneficial to explore research from other sleep scientists to see if they corroborate these precise nap-timing recommendations. 🧪 Investigating studies on the ideal length and timing of naps for different cognitive benefits could offer a broader perspective. ⚖️ It would also be useful to compare the Nap Wheel's approach to other popular sleep-tracking apps or devices to understand how they measure and recommend sleep stages.
