## 📖 Book Report: The Art of Rest: How to Find Respite in the Modern Age  
  
### 🔎 Overview  
  
* 📚 *The Art of Rest* by Claudia Hammond is a research-based exploration into the importance of rest in our modern, often hyper-busy lives. 📊 Drawing significantly from "The Rest Test," the largest global survey on rest ever undertaken (with over 18,000 participants across 135 countries), the book challenges the 🏅 notion that busyness is a badge of honor and argues that rest is a vital necessity for well-being, creativity, and productivity. 👩‍⚕️ Hammond, a psychologist, writer, and BBC broadcaster, combines scientific insights with personal stories to delve into why we struggle to rest and how we can better integrate it into our lives.  
  
### 🔑 Key Themes and Concepts

* 🏃‍♀️ **The Busyness Problem:** Modern society often glorifies being busy, leading many to feel exhausted and guilty about resting.  
* 📝 **The Rest Test:** A foundational element of the book is the analysis of this extensive survey, which revealed that a significant majority (68%) of people feel they need more rest. 🤔 The survey also explored attitudes towards relaxation and busyness.  
* ❤️ **Rest and Well-being:** The survey results indicated a direct link between perceived rest levels and subjective well-being; those who felt they got more rest reported higher well-being scores.
