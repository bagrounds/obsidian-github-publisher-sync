# 😇😈💔 The Righteous Mind: Why Liberals and Conservatives Can't Get Along  
!['The Righteous Mind': Why Liberals and Conservatives Can't Get Along](https://youtu.be/qN42ZLwNFBY)  
  
## 🤖 **AI Summary**  
  
* Humans are not **rational** 🧠 creatures; moral judgments are made quickly, intuitively, and emotionally, with reasons fabricated afterward.  
* The **"rider and elephant"** 🐘 metaphor explains that reasoning (the rider) is subservient to intuition and emotion (the elephant), merely serving as a press secretary to justify the elephant's decisions.  
* The video discusses six **moral foundations** ⚖️: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression.  
* Liberals tend to focus primarily on the first two foundations—**Care/Harm** ❤️‍🩹 and **Fairness/Cheating**—while conservatives engage with all six.  
* **Political polarization** 📊 is fueled by various factors, including the purification of political parties, the sorting of voters, changes in Congress that ended friendships, and media fractionation.  
* A key historical moment for this polarization was the **realignment of the South** 🗺️ into the Republican party after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.  
* Morality both **binds and blinds** 🙈, creating strong in-group loyalty but also preventing members from seeing the flaws of their own group or the truths of opposing groups.  
* Humans are 90% chimp 🦍 (selfish) and 10% bee 🐝 (groupish), with an innate "hive switch" that allows them to transcend self-interest for the good of the group.  
  
## 🤔 **Evaluation**  
  
The video's perspective, rooted in social psychology, suggests that political divisions are driven by deep-seated psychological and evolutionary mechanisms rather than a simple failure of reason or ethics. This view **contrasts** ⚔️ with purely political or economic explanations that might focus solely on policy differences or self-interest. To gain a better understanding, one could explore the **sociological** and **historical** factors 📜 that contribute to political polarization, such as the influence of media and the role of systemic inequalities, which go beyond individual psychology. Further research into the work of thinkers who propose different solutions to political division, such as those focusing on economic reform or specific policy changes, would also provide a useful **contrast** to the psychological approach presented.  
  
## 📚 **Book Recommendations**  
  
* [😇🧠 The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion](../books/the-righteous-mind.md) by Jonathan Haidt, a perfect companion for a deeper dive into the moral foundations and psychology presented in the video.  
* Strangers in Their Own Land by Arlie Russell Hochschild, offers a contrasting perspective by exploring the political and emotional landscape of conservatives in a way that builds empathy.  
* [🤔🐇🐢 Thinking, Fast and Slow](../books/thinking-fast-and-slow.md) by Daniel Kahneman, provides a broader context for the **intuitive versus rational** mind concept discussed in the video, with a focus on cognitive biases.  
* The Coddling of the American Mind by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt, a creatively related book that applies the principles of moral psychology to understand trends in higher education and mental health.
