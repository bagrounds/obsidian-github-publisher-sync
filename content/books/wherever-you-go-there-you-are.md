* 🧑‍🏫 **Author:** Jon Kabat-Zinn, PhD  
* 📅 **Publication Date:** 1994 (with subsequent editions, including a 10th-anniversary edition in 2004 with a new afterword).  
* ℹ️ **Context:** 🧘‍♂️ Kabat-Zinn is a renowned meditation teacher, scientist, and the founder of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. 🧑‍⚕️ He is also the creator of the widely used Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program.  
  
### 🧠 Core Concepts  
  
* 🧘 **Mindfulness Definition:** 📖 The book defines mindfulness as paying attention intentionally, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.  
* ⏱️ **Present Moment Awareness:** 🧘‍♂️ It emphasizes the importance of grounding oneself in the "now," rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.  
* 🧘‍♀️ **Being vs. Doing:** 🧘 Mindfulness is presented as a state of "being" – simply observing and accepting the present reality – rather than constantly "doing" or striving.  
* 👁️ **Non-Judgmental Observation:** 🔑 A key aspect is learning to observe thoughts, feelings, and sensations without labeling them as good or bad, simply acknowledging their presence.
