# Job Guarantee / Employer of Last Resort  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
**High-Level Summary:**  
The Job Guarantee (JG), also known as Employer of Last Resort (ELR), is an economic policy proposal that aims to eliminate involuntary unemployment by providing a government-funded job to anyone willing and able to work. 🤝 The core principle is that the government acts as the "employer of last resort," guaranteeing employment at a living wage, thus establishing a floor for wages and stabilizing the economy. The goal is to ensure full employment, reduce poverty, and create valuable public goods and services. 🌟 It's significant because it offers a direct solution to unemployment, with potential ripple effects on social welfare, economic equality, and overall economic stability. 📈
