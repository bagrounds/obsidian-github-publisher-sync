# 🤖🧠📈⚡ Code execution with MCP: Building more efficient agents  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
  
* 🛠️ Tool definitions **overload context**, forcing agents to process vast tokens before a request when connected to many tools.  
* 🔄 Intermediate tool results **consume extra tokens** because full documents must flow through the model's context, often flowing twice.  
* 🐌 Inefficiency increases **cost and latency** for agents.  
* 💻 Code execution presents **MCP servers as code APIs** instead of direct tool calls to boost context efficiency.  
* 🔎 Progressive disclosure allows agents to explore a tool file tree and **load only needed definitions** on-demand, dramatically cutting token use.  
* 🧠 Agents achieve **context efficient tool results** by filtering and transforming large datasets in the execution environment, passing only small, relevant data back to the model.  
* ✨ **Powerful, context-efficient control flow** uses code patterns like loops and conditionals, eliminating chained tool calls and model-level waits.  
* 🛡️ **Privacy-preserving operations** keep intermediate results within the execution environment, preventing data you do not wish to share from entering the model's context.  
* 🔐 Sensitive data is **tokenized automatically** by the MCP client before reaching the LLM, protecting PII during the workflow.  
* 💾 **State persistence and skills** are maintained via files, letting agents resume work and save reusable functions, building an evolving toolbox of high-level capabilities.  
* ⚠️ Code execution **introduces complexity**, requiring a secure, sandboxed environment with resource limits and monitoring, which adds operational overhead and security concerns.  
  
## 🤔 Evaluation  
  
* ✅ This model aligns with research on **secure LLM agent design**, which argues for principles like **least privilege** according to the paper *LLM Agents Should Employ Security Principles* from OpenReview.  
* 🔑 By loading only necessary tools via progressive disclosure, the agent inherently follows the **least privilege** principle, reducing its exposure to unnecessary systems and data.  
* 🤝 The focus on **PII sanitization** through tokenization is a known strategy, reinforced by commercial tools like Kong AI Gateway, which offer similar services for securing agent interactions (AIMultiple).  
* 🛑 A necessary caution is that high flexibility introduces challenges; a **contrasting perspective** from a *Comparative Analysis of LLM Agent Frameworks* (Jose F. Sosa on Medium) highlights that conversational or code-heavy systems like AutoGen can be **unpredictable** and need more engineering for stability.  
* 🚧 The move from direct tool calls to agent-generated code requires a **significant increase in security engineering** and robustness, a trade-off the article correctly acknowledges.  
  
* ❓ Topics to explore for better understanding include the **sandboxing and isolation techniques** Anthropic uses to safely run LLM-generated code.  
* 📊 A deeper look at the **cost-benefit analysis** of setting up and maintaining a secure execution environment versus the token cost savings (e.g., the 98.7% reduction claim) would provide practical insight.  
* 📝 Further investigation into the **governance and compliance rules** for storing agent-persisted code and intermediate data ("skills") on the filesystem is needed.  
  
## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### ⚙️ Q: What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how does code execution make it better?  
⭐ A: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard connecting large language model (LLM) agents to external tools and data. 🚀 Code execution improves it by treating tools as code libraries. The agent writes and runs code in a secure environment to interact with tools, only loading what it needs and processing large data outside the model's context, which drastically cuts down on token usage and increases speed.  
  
### 🤫 Q: How does code execution improve the security and privacy of LLM agents?  
👁️ A: Code execution boosts security by ensuring **privacy-preserving operations**; intermediate results stay in a local execution environment, preventing data from being exposed to the model's context. 🛑 Also, the MCP client automatically **tokenizes sensitive data** like PII before the LLM sees it, protecting data integrity even during processing.  
  
### 💰 Q: What are the main efficiency problems with traditional LLM agent tool-calling?  
📉 A: Traditional tool-calling causes two main issues: **context window overload** and **intermediate result token consumption**. 📚 When many tools are connected, loading all definitions upfront consumes hundreds of thousands of tokens. 📄 Furthermore, large tool results, like full document transcripts, must pass through the model's context multiple times for multi-step tasks, slowing down the agent and spiking costs.
