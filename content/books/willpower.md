# Willpower  
_Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength_  
  
## 🤖 AI Summary  
### 📖 Book Report: Willpower  
  
#### TL;DR 🎯✨  
  
"Willpower" argues that willpower is a limited resource, like a muscle 💪, that can be depleted or strengthened 🌱, and that understanding and managing this resource is crucial for achieving goals 🏆 and improving life 🌟.

## 📝🐒 Human Notes  
- Meaningful self regulation requires goals  
- Frequent self monitoring of behavior relative to goals is critical for effective self control  
- Willpower is a generic, finite resource  
  - the same reserves that we use to avoid junk food or pursue a fitness goal fuel our drive to stay on task at work or stick to a new bedtime routine  
- Glucose replenishes willpower  
  - sweet drinks are often used in scientific experiments to demonstrate the replenishment of willpower reserves  
  - but it may be more practical in life to habitually rely on slower dietary fuels, like protein, than to rely on the fast boost from sugary drinks  
- Practice can improve our willpower capacity. Some examples include  
  - Maintaining good posture  
  - a right-handed person brushing their teeth with their left hand  
- People with the strongest willpower tend to rely on it less often  
  - Use willpower to proactively develop good habits and shape our environments such that we don't need much willpower to do the right thing on a regular basis
