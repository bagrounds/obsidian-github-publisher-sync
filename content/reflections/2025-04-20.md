## 👀🤔 Query-Dependent Google Search Results Title Rendering  
📝 A lot of page titles on my site include 🖼️ emojis.  
🤔 Depending on the search query, 🤖 Google might render the title with 🚫 or ✅ without the 🖼️ emojis.  
💡 Examples:  
  
| Query                                   | Rendered Title                                               |
