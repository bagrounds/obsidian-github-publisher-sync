## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)  
  
### 👮 Q: Can ICE legally detain United States citizens?  
  
🛡️ A: ICE must release individuals immediately upon discovering they are US citizens, yet over 170 citizens have been detained due to chaotic enforcement and lack of oversight \[[05:20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I1XwrYvrfg&t=320)].  
  
### ⚖️ Q: Do immigrants have the right to a lawyer in the immigration system?  
  
🛡️ A: Because immigration is a civil system rather than criminal, many standard rights like the right to court-appointed counsel do not apply, despite the use of criminal-style detention \[[08:13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I1XwrYvrfg&t=493)].  
  
### 🏛️ Q: Is it legal for the President to use the military to control domestic crime?  
  
🛡️ A: While laws like 10 USC 12406 allow federalizing the National Guard, using them for routine street crime is historically unprecedented and bypasses traditional state-level requests for aid \[[18:53](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I1XwrYvrfg&t=1133)].
