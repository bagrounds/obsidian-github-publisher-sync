🔨 The hammer swings a steady beat  
🥈 Against the silver grain  
☀️ He doesn't mind the summer heat  
🌧️ Or the drumming of the rain  
🪵 A man of wood and measured lines  
🪚 With sawdust in his hair  
🌲 He reads the language of the pines  
🌬️ And breathes the cedar air  
  
🏠 It’s not just four walls and a door  
😏 He’ll say with a quiet grin  
🏗️ It’s knowing what the frame is for  
❤️ And what you keep within  
🛠️ He builds the things that meant to last  
📐 The joints all tight and true  
🌉 A bridge between a sturdy past  
✨ And what he’s meant to do  
  
🤫 He isn’t one for heavy talk  
🏃 Or chasing after fame  
🚶 He’d rather take a quiet walk  
🌾 Through fields without a name  
🤝 But if you ask him for a hand  
⛰️ Or why he works the hill  
🌱 He’ll show you how to treat the land  
👤 For that is just Bob Will
